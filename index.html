<h2><b>Short overview of me:</b></h2>

<p>I co-founded <a href='https://www.apolloresearch.ai/'>Apollo Research</a>. I was doing my PhD in Machine Learning under the supervision of Philipp Hennig at the University of Tuebingen (currently writing up thesis). I'm excited about what ML can achieve but want to ensure that it is done in a safe and aligned manner. I do/did university debating.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about my personality, my posts on opinions I changed (<a href='http://www.mariushobbhahn.com/2020-05-10-Opinion_change/'>part I</a>, <a href='https://www.mariushobbhahn.com/2021-04-24-opinion_change_2/'>part II</a>, or <a href='https://www.mariushobbhahn.com/2022-05-23-opinion_change_3/'>part III</a>). For an overview of my career you can look at my <a href='https://mariushobbhahn.github.io/aboutme/'>‘CV’</a>.</p>

<h2><b>Machine Learning Projects:</b></h2>

<p>In the <a href='https://mariushobbhahn.github.io/MLprojects/'>ML projects section</a> I explain papers I have written, projects I have completed and find worth talking about, and essays regarding the topic of Machine Learning in general. For a more detailed overview of the purpose of that part of the blog see my <a href='https://mariushobbhahn.github.io/2019-10-19-what_is_ML_projects_about/'>'What is the ML Projects part about'</a> article.</p>

<h2><b>Opinions:</b></h2>

<p>In the <a href='https://mariushobbhahn.github.io/Opinions/'>Opinions section</a> I mainly post essays and opinion pieces on ethics and policy that I think are useful to share. For a more detailed overview of the purpose of this part of the blog see my <a href='https://mariushobbhahn.github.io/2019-10-19-what_is_Opinions_about/'>‘What is the Opinions part about’</a> article.</p>
