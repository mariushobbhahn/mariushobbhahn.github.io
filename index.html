<h2><b>Short overview of me:</b></h2>

<p>I am currently doing my PhD in Machine Learning under the supervision of Philipp Hennig at the University of Tuebingen and am generally pretty hyped about the field while also trying to find ways in which AI can be deployed in safe and fair manners. I am an Effective Altruist. I debate. I am on average left leaning on social issues but with high variance. I am, for example, in favor of more LGBTQ+ rights but not the biggest fan of identity politics because, at least in my experience, we start to ignore the evidence and numbers as soon as we categorize each other too much into different social groups/identities/tribes - and I really like to look at the numbers. My economic positions are hard to put on the left/right spectrum since I hold positions of both ends, e.g. I think more radical redistribution of wealth would be great, but markets could be applied in more areas than they currently are. If you want to know more about my personality my posts on <a href='http://www.mariushobbhahn.com/2020-05-10-Opinion_change/'>opinions I changed</a> and <a href='http://www.mariushobbhahn.com/2019-12-23-EA_and_me/'>Effective Altruism</a> would be a good start. For an overview of my career you can look at my <a href='https://mariushobbhahn.github.io/aboutme/'>‘CV’</a></p>.


  <h2><b>Machine Learning Projects:</b></h2>

<p>In the <a href='https://mariushobbhahn.github.io/MLprojects/'>ML projects section</a> I explain papers I have written, projects I have completed and find worth talking about and essays regarding the topic of Machine Learning in general. For a more detailed overview of the purpose of that part of the blog see my <a href='https://mariushobbhahn.github.io/2019-10-19-what_is_ML_projects_about/'>'What is the ML Projects part about'</a> article.</p>

  <h2><b>Opinions:</b></h2>

<p>In the <a href='https://mariushobbhahn.github.io/Opinions/'>Opinions section</a> I mainly post essays and opinion pieces on ethics and policy that I think are useful to share. For a more detailed overview of the purpose of this part of the blog see my <a href='https://mariushobbhahn.github.io/2019-10-19-what_is_Opinions_about/'>‘What is the Opinions part about’</a> article.</p>
