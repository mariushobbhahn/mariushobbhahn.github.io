<h2><b>Short overview of me:</b></h2>

<p>I am the CEO and co-founder of <a href='https://www.apolloresearch.ai/'>Apollo Research</a>. I'm currently primarily thinking about AI model evaluations ("evals"). I'm excited about the benefits that AI can create but to ensure humanity benefits from AI, I primarily work on reducing the downside risks of AI systems. I'm particularly interested in the problem of scheming, where AI systems covertly pursue misaligned goals.</p>

<p>For more details, see my <a href='https://mariushobbhahn.github.io/aboutme/'>‘CV’</a>. Not all of my writing is on this blog. You can find most of my latest work on the <a href='https://www.apolloresearch.ai/'>Apollo website</a>.</p>

<h2><b>Evals</b></h2>

<p>I want to build and grow the evals field. In the <a href='https://mariushobbhahn.github.io/evals/'>Evals section</a> I list relevant evals resources and describe my field building plans.</p>

<h2><b>Machine Learning Projects:</b></h2>

<p>In the <a href='https://mariushobbhahn.github.io/MLprojects/'>ML projects section</a> I discuss selected ML projects.</p>
