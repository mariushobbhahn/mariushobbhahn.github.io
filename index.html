<h2><b>Short overview of me:</b></h2>

<p>I co-founded <a href='https://www.apolloresearch.ai/'>Apollo Research</a>. I'm interested in AI model evaluations and interpretability. I'm excited about what ML can achieve but want to ensure that it is done in a safe and aligned manner.
Previously, I was doing my PhD in Machine Learning under the supervision of Philipp Hennig at the University of Tuebingen (currently wrapping up thesis).

I'm not posting a lot on this blog anymore. You can find my latest writings on the <a href='https://www.apolloresearch.ai/'>Apollo website</a>.

For an overview of my career you can look at my <a href='https://mariushobbhahn.github.io/aboutme/'>‘CV’</a>.</p>

<h2><b>Machine Learning Projects:</b></h2>

<p>In the <a href='https://mariushobbhahn.github.io/MLprojects/'>ML projects section</a> I explain papers I have written, projects I have completed and find worth talking about, and essays regarding the topic of Machine Learning in general. For a more detailed overview of the purpose of that part of the blog see my <a href='https://mariushobbhahn.github.io/2019-10-19-what_is_ML_projects_about/'>'What is the ML Projects part about'</a> article.</p>
