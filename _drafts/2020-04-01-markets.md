## **What is this post about?**

Over the last couple of years I had to debate for or against markets a lot of times in one way or the other. Some of the issues that I talk about are not directly related to markets but broader economic stances. Correct me if you think I am wrong. I am more economically liberal now than I expected or was in the past. 

### Conditions for markets to work

I undervalued the effectiveness of markets and the many possibilities it can be used to solve problems. Frankly, in many cases, I also didn't understand markets sufficiently and therefore didn't trust them. A lengthy explanation deserves its own post which I will make at some point in the future. However, the short version is this: There are some conditions that should be met for markets to work. If they are met, I think markets are likely the most accurate tool to make predictions, price things, or calibrate beliefs about the world. The conditions are
1. **Incentives:** They are the most obvious - if people can't make any money they probably won't bother engaging in the market.
2. **No natural monopolies and access to many people:** Natural monopolies can occur in situations where you either have very high entry cost, i.e. you need to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to build a railway network, or where the good that is being sold relies on a distribution network that exists only once. For example, when one company owns the railway network, the water pipes, or the telecommunication network of a country it does not make sense for a competitor to build a second network next to it. Therefore, you have no competition and the service will decline while the prices rise. I think this can be seen by how bad the results of the privatization of water have been for most countries. Additionally, there should be access to many people since the more people participate in a market, the more accurate is the price, prediction, etc.
3. **No infrastructure:** I think infrastructure should be built and maintained by states most of the time. This is for the simple reason that the costs of infrastructure are local but the benefits are global. Building a new and larger road, for example, is a money drain most of the time. You need to service it properly, fix all the holes, etc. The benefits of the road, however, mostly come from the access that companies now have to faster transportation of goods and people, etc. This means that the profits of infrastructure are very indirect, namely the increasing economic value and the taxes that are generated by it. A single company has to make a profit directly from operating the road. This means they either have to take charges, which decreases the number of people using it and thereby its functionality or they don't build the road in the first place because it is not profitable. A government, on the other hand, can take a loss for the road every single year and still make up for it due to the increase in tax revenue.
4. **Limited possibility to change the outcome:** I think betting markets are generally a good tool to get accurate predictions about future events. A betting market for weather, for example, might yield more accurate predictions than choosing your favourite weather station. However, these ideas only work if the outcome cannot be tampered with. An interesting idea, for example, would be to have betting markets on the likelihood of re-offence for prisoners. There are lots of biases in the judicial system and a market could overcome those. However, someone who has bet a lot on a person re-offending might try to actively increase the probability for this event by attacking the person or mentally bullying them. The wheather on the other hand is harder to fuck around with.

In conclusion, I think that there are some parts of society that markets are ill-suited to solve problems, e.g. water, infrastructure, public transport and some parts of health care. However, markets can be used in more ways than they currently are in other parts of society, especially when it comes to predicting future events or CO2 reduction schemes like emissions trading.

### Some things I am unsure about

Health care private or public and to which extend?

### Monopolies work less often than I thought

There are lots of situations in which people fear a monopoly within a certain market and some companies business model rely entirely on achieving a monopoly. My best explanation for Ubers business model, for example, is a three-step process: a) Achieve market dominance (i.e. a monopoly) b) build self-driving cars c) raise prices and profit. Netflix also seems to prioritize market dominance over short-term profitability and many other platform driven companies try to do the same. Most of them burn a lot of money now in the hopes of achieving a monopoly and becoming a cashcow in the future. However, I'm not so sure whether these strategies pay off. You can only milk your cashcow if people keep using your platform and decide against changing the product and I think some of these companies overestimate the cost of changing for most individuals. Just because I am used to using the Uber-app does not mean I am not willing to download Lyft as soon as Uber raises their prices. Similarly, if Netflix is too expensive I don't see any reason not to just switch to Amazon, Disney or other online-streaming platforms. Clearly, there are examples where the cost of switching is higher because some of the products you have interact well with each other, i.e. having an Apple IPhone and Mac or when all of your friends use a certain social network like facebook it is unreasonable for you, as an individual, to switch. But even in these domains there were very strong market shifts in the past. Remember Blackberry and MySpace? They had nearly complete market dominance and go completely crushed by the competition after some bad management decisions. An even stronger example is inter-city transport in Germany. Some people always feared that the "Deutsche Bahn" a partly private and partly public train company had a monopoly on inter-city transport and therefore could make too much money from their train connections. However, a bus company, Flixbus, provided way cheaper means of transportation between cities and thereby provided good competition for Deutsche Bahn. Interestingly, the strategy of Flixbus was/is to get a monopoly on European road transportation and drive their competition out of business. However, the switching cost for downloading a different app and using a bus that has is painted in a different color and run by a different company don't seem very high. I therefore expect that the competition within this business will still be possible even if Flixbus has market dominance. I guess my best conclusion from these observations is that people are likely to switch even if there are some cost attached to it as long as the difference in quality is felt through higher prices or worse quality. The domains in which you have monopolies that are very hard to break are those outlined above: Water, sanitation and infrastructure. The switching cost are not only high but usually there just is no competition because it doesn't make sense to build a water pipe next to an already existing pipe. One thing that I find quite funny is that most of the efforts to achieve market dominance and milk a monopoly cashcow actually lead to effects that are opposite to what the investors desire. They burn lots of money and hope that they can then reap the benefits later. If the monopoly is never achieved, they essentially redistributed their money to the masses by providing undervalued services. In the end they are the cashcow that we were milking all along.
