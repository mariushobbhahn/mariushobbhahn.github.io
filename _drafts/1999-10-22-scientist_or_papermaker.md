## **What is this post about?**

I love science but I dislike academia. There are a ton of systemic things you can do TODO: list, new forms of publishing, ICLR_mentor thing by marc, pre-registration, etc.

Fundamental problem: incentives of researchers misaligned with science at large. 

Trying to do things. More information gain than personal gain. 

Might crash and burn. Doing an experiment N=1. Maybe academia isn't as bad. Maybe everyone will hate me for it. In all cases, you can assume good intentions and that I'm willing to change my mind when presented with good arguments. Maybe I'm just a lunatic and you think I'm overexaturating. 

DISCLAIMER: Philipp is not at fault, pushing me or anything. I don't have a lot of experience in ML. Maybe just randomness. 

## Honest papers

Be honest in current papers. If my method is worse in some circumstances, I'll just say so. If I don't know why, I'll say so. If there are problems that we fix with quick fixes, I'll say it's a quick fix and not pretend it's a rigorous solution. 

Write blog posts on negative results.

Review process. No more BS rebuttal. 

## More sharing

Big fear: being scooped. 

More ideas than I have time for. Usually ideas get better with feedback. Someone else might have had this idea and is already working on it. Somebody might steal it. 

## Failing faster

X papers in timespan. At some point you just want a paper and make your time worth. Feels like people want to be busy rather than find something. 

## Larger risks

Guys, we want to achieve something. We should aim bigger. 

## The transparent researcher

Basically write down everything I do during a project and make it transparent.
