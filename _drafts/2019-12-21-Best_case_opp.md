## **What is this post about?** 

Rationality -> best case opposition. Things that smart people believe and I don't understand why. Not climate change opposition. Post the most convincing answers that I get.

### Continental Philosophy:

what is this even?

### Not pulling the lever:

pull the lever 5>1. Consequentialism and rawls.

### Not investing all your not needed money in ETFs

### EA

### Gender is not entirely socially constructed

#### ***One last note***

If you have any feedback regarding anything (i.e. layout, code or opinions) I would be happy if you told me. But please do it in a constructive manner.
