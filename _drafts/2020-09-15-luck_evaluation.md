## **What is this post about?**

Intro: wanted to do this for a long time. Twitter nudged me to do it :)

Can't solve Nature, nurture & ind. decisions. -> try to explain where I think ind. decisions played a role. 

Prior estimate: 1% in Germany, 0.01% Worldwide

Disclaimer: not trying to show off. I just got lucky. Trying to be as objective as possible. If you think I missrepresent or deny stuff contact me. 

## The Lottery of Birth

Large or largets influence on life outcomes (Is there solid evidence?)

### World

Germany is pretty good on most global comparisons: econ, gini, freedom index, press, livable cities, health care, education, etc.

### Within Germany

Nuremberg is fine. SPD mayor for the longest time. no major fuckups just solid. See livable cities index. 

### My Person

IQ, Genes, Eyesight, diseases, Parents (job, PhD, smart), privilege tests

## My Upbringing

no hard pressures, rather liberal, good nudges, eigenverantwortung, work for your stuff, mit geld umgehen, good habits (reading news, watching educational videos), choices have consequences (being 'sick')

## Early Adulthood

post 18. After school until now. Credit assignment gets harder because counterfactual unclear

EA & Debating -> lucky

Uni -> somewhat lucky but also a lot of work

Stusti -> deserved but always luck involved

TÃ¼bingen -> lucky that ML important

PhD -> luckiest person ever: group and project -> willing to work the weekends

## Conclusions and Implications

Hard to disentangle: previous luck and path dependencies, previous choices, If rationality gives you guidelines are you even making the choices? If you read SSC aren't you just imitating Scott Alexander? ;)

Assuming similar upbringing and lottery of birth 70 luck: 30 choices. Potentially more luck. 

Am I priviledged -> YES!!!!

Is this fair -> NO!!!!

1. systems perspective, attribute more to luck and randomness. Thank the lottery of birth, RNG and the seed of our simulation.

2. Change the system, EA, not guilt-driven
