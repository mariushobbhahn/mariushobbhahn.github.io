## **What is this post about?**

In this blog post I investigate something that I wanted to put a number on for a long time: an estimate of my privilege/luck that I had and still have. I toyed with the idea for a while but the crucial nudge came through Twitter where someone asked me to estimate luck and priviledge since my previous blog posts approximate suffering (Part I, Part II) TODO:links. 

Obviously, I will not solve the nature vs. nurture vs. individual choice debate in my blog post but I will try to attach numbers to my estimate when they are available and try to give estimates that align with my intuition with associated uncertainty whenever possible. 

I have tried to link as many of my sources as possible and create a github repo TODO:link for additional materials if you want to follow along and estimate your own priviledge. My prior before researching and writing the blog post is that I am in the 99.99th percentile of privileged people globally speaking (ignoring time privilege because the future is hard to estimate). This prior arises from the fact that I was born in Germany, which I would say roughly aligns with the top 1 percent of living quality worldwide, and the fact that I was born into a pretty lucky societal position. I roughly speaking tick most boxes of privilege, e.g. my parents are well-educated, I am not part of a racial, religious or sexual minority, etc. and would therefore estimate that I'm also in the 99th percentile of privilege within Germany. Even though this is not the correct way to multiply probability distributions I will combine these two estimates to a very rough idea of being in the 99.99th percentile globally. To make this prior more graphic consider the following thought experiment: If you are in a pre-societal state, i.e. a literal lottery of birth, and you had to flip a coin continuously - if you get heads you double your privilege and are allowed to flip the coin again - if you get tails you get born. I would have gotten heads 13 times in a row before beign born if my prior turns out to be somewhat accurate.

As you might have noticed already I expect myself to be pretty privileged on a global comparison. I want to emphasize that I don't intend to show off with this post but try to be as objective as I can. I really just got lucky and try to give back to society wherever I can. If you think my estimates are inaccurate, I missrepresent or deny something please let me know. 

## The Lottery of Birth

I would guess that the geographic location of you birth is probably one of the best predictors of your expected living standards. It can mean the difference between being born into a poor family in a war-ridden society that has to fear hunger and homelessness and being born into a wealthy family in a stable society being able to afford good education and health care. Clearly, this is not fully deterministic of your life outcomes. A person that had bad luck in the lottery of birth could still end up in a happy place and vice versa. But probabilistically speaking it has a large influence - on average it will be much harder to achieve the same goal if you were born into very different locations in the world and places in society. The in-society privilege variance is also pretty high. Even when you are born into a stable and wealthy society your parents could still be rich or poor, minorities or not, educated or not, etc.

### World

Germany is pretty good on most global comparisons: econ, gini, freedom index, press, livable cities, health care, education, etc.

### Within Germany

Nuremberg is fine. SPD mayor for the longest time. no major fuckups just solid. See livable cities index. 

### My Person

IQ, Genes, Eyesight, diseases, Parents (job, PhD, smart), privilege tests

https://www.buzzfeed.com/regajha/how-privileged-are-you?bfsource=bfocompareon buzzfeed: 80/100 = 98 percentile

More of a direction some problems: subjective (how rich are you), bike rider (is this a vehicle?), being a student, being an atheist

## My Upbringing

no hard pressures, rather liberal, good nudges, eigenverantwortung, work for your stuff, mit geld umgehen, good habits (reading news, watching educational videos), choices have consequences (being 'sick')

## Early Adulthood

post 18. After school until now. Credit assignment gets harder because counterfactual unclear

EA & Debating -> lucky

Uni -> somewhat lucky but also a lot of work

Stusti -> deserved but always luck involved

Tübingen -> lucky that ML important

PhD -> luckiest person ever: group and project -> willing to work the weekends

## Conclusions and Implications

Hard to disentangle: previous luck and path dependencies, previous choices, If rationality gives you guidelines are you even making the choices? If you read SSC aren't you just imitating Scott Alexander? ;)

Assuming similar upbringing and lottery of birth 70 luck: 30 choices. Potentially more luck. 

Am I priviledged -> YES!!!!

Is this fair -> NO!!!!

1. systems perspective, attribute more to luck and randomness. Thank the lottery of birth, RNG and the seed of our simulation.

2. Change the system, EA, not guilt-driven
