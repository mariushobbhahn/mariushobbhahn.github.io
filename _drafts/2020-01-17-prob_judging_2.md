This post is not yet finished. I am still gathering feedback. You can read it anyway if you like but it will likely change a bit in the near future. 

## What is this mini-series about?

The overall purpose of these posts is to build a framework to judge debates probabilistically and illustrate how some parts of adjudication should work in my opinion. Part I (TODO:link) dealt with a single argument made by a team in a vacuum. Part III (TODO:link) will deal with the overall comparison between different arguments and metrics. As already emphasizes in the first part I want these posts to be as understandable as possible even for people that do not have any background in statistics or math. If you do not understand a certain explanaition please let me know such that I can make it more clear. If you have understood the explanation but think it is an incorrect model of debating please let me know as well, such that we can work out a better version.

## Part II: Interaction

The two kinds of interaction that I want to focus on in this post explicitely are direct rebuttal and some extensions. 

### Direct Rebuttal

Broadly speaking there are three kinds of rebuttal. Rebuttal that is mitigatory, rebuttal that refutes an argument and rebuttal that flips an argument. Of course there are additional possibilities to deal with the argument of another team like framing the argument out of the debate or similar stuff. However these techniques do not deal with the argument directly but rather tell me to care less about the overall clash on which it is based. For example, even if that argument is well made and people die, this debate is more about a principled question because of XYZ. In this part of the illustration I want to focus on the kinds of ways to rebutt an argument that directly engage with it instead of framing it out of the debate. 

1. **Mitigatory rebuttal:** This includes any form of saying: "Your argument is overall correct but it is less true or less relevant than you made it look like". TODO:elaborate and illustrate.

2. **Refuting rebuttal:** This includes any form of saying: "Your argument is either not true or not relevant at all", and thereby reducing the overall effect of this argument to zero. In the comparison between the team that made the argument and the team that rebutted it, a successful refutation is equivalent to one team not having made the argument at all. This is only true for this comparison though. TODO: elaborate and illustrate.

3. **Flipping rebuttal:** This includes any form of saying: "Either the premisses of your argument are wrong and if you take the correct premisses the arguments is on our side, or the effect you are describing are actually desirable for our side because of XYZ". If successfully executed flipping an argument not only means the other side overexaggerated or made a wrong claim they have made a claim that is, in fact, harming them and helping the other side. TODO: elaborate and illustrate.


### Extensions

Broadly speaking there are two kind of extensions that directly interact with an argument made by the opening half of the bench. I will call them analysis extension and impact extension. There are clearly more ways to extend an opening team from closing half, such as makeing a weighing to solve opening halfs open question, introducing a new argument or reframing the debate. These will be delt with more explicitely in part III, in this part I want to focus explicitely on the two kind of extensions that use an argument made in the opening half and try to extend it. 

1. **Analysis extension:**

2. **Impact extension:**
