This post is not yet finished. I am still gathering feedback. You can read it anyway if you like but it will likely change a bit in the near future. 

## What is this mini-series about?

TODO: short framing for part I and III

## Part II: Interaction

TODO: what kind of argumentation and what not




## Rebuttal as Constructive

TODO

## Limitations of the model:

Willingness to interact is not counted

## Nerd section: some statistical explanations 

***One last note:***

If you have any feedback regarding anything (i.e. layout or opinions) please tell me in a constructive manner via your preferred means of communication.
