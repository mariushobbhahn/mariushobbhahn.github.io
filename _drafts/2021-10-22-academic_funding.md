## **What is this post about?**

This year, I organised the ELLIS doctoral symposium 2021 (TODO link). The plan was to get 100 PhD students from all over Europe to TÃ¼bingen connect with each other, have some talks, etc. 

This doesn't sound too complicated - find a venue, find some speakers, organise food, organise some socials and communicate with the participants. I have organised debate tournaments of a similar size with very similar tasks, so I figured it couldn't be that different. But I was very wrong, debate tournaments are funded by the participants and our symposium was funded by ELLIS, i.e. tax-payer money - and this makes all the difference. 

The team of organisers was three times as large as for a debate tournament, the budget was larger, we had lots of experienced advisors and yet the entire process took much longer. I would attribute 25% of the additional time to Covid and the remaining 75% to all the rules that make your life miserable. 

I don't want this post to be only a rant but also give a little bit of analysis of what I think is going wrong and provide some tips for first-time organisers.

### Disclaimers

1. This post is **more ranty and less neutral than my others posts**. Unfortunately, though, I'm unable not to be tilted and sad about the loss of money, time and mental energy due to the soul crushing inefficiency of public funding. I apologise in advance. 
2. **Don't hate the players, hate the game**. I hope this is clear from the text, but the admins and organisers working for public institutions are not at fault and not to blame for any of the problems. In fact, quite the opposite is true. Without them, our event could never have happened because we would have been completely and hopelessly lost in regulation. This should also serve as a reminder that a lot of scientific events - **and the resulting scientific advances** - are only possible because a mostly anonymous person in admin was willing to work their ass off.
3. **Covid** Organising an event during a pandemic obviously didn't make it easier, but it further exposed some of the problems that I personally encountered with the system.

I might do it again, but very different
