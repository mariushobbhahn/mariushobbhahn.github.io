## **What is this post about?**

This year, I organised the ELLIS doctoral symposium 2021 (TODO link). The plan was to get 100 PhD students from all over Europe to Tübingen connect with each other, have some talks, etc. 

This doesn't sound too complicated - find a venue, find some speakers, organise food, organise some socials and communicate with the participants. I have organised debate tournaments of a similar size with very similar tasks, so I figured it couldn't be that different. But I was very wrong, debate tournaments are funded by the participants and our symposium was funded by ELLIS, i.e. tax-payer money - and this makes all the difference. 

The team of organisers was three times as large as for a debate tournament, the budget was larger, we had lots of experienced advisors and yet the entire process took much longer. I would attribute 25% of the additional time to Covid and 75% to all the rules that make your life miserable. 

I don't want this post to be only a rant but also give a little bit of analysis of what I think is going wrong and provide some tips for first-time organisers.

### Disclaimers

1. This post is **more ranty and less neutral than my others posts**. Unfortunately, though, I'm unable not to be tilted and sad about the loss of money, time and mental energy due to the soul crushing inefficiency of public funding. I personally also have a strong efficiency fetish, so all the wasted time and money might affect me much more than the average person. I apologise in advance.
2. **Don't hate the players, hate the game**. I hope this is clear from the text, but the admins and organisers working for public institutions are not at fault and not to blame for any of the problems. In fact, quite the opposite is true. Without them, our event could never have happened because we would have been completely and hopelessly lost in regulation. This should also serve as a reminder that a lot of scientific events - **and the resulting scientific advances** - are only possible because a mostly anonymous person in admin was willing to work their ass off. In particular I would like to thank Georg, Melanie, Lynn, Daniela and Eliza for their support. And, of course, I would like to thank all the lovely other PhDs who joined forces with me. TODO link
3. **Covid** Organising an event during a pandemic obviously didn't make it easier, but it further exposed some of the problems that I personally encountered with the system. Obviously, everyone was vaccinated, we worse masks, etc. 
4. **It's my first organisation**. Since this is the first time I'm organising a large event, I might have fallen into more pitfalls than necessary and more experienced organisers would have moved through the system with ease. However, just the fact that there are so many pitfalls in the first place, already indicates to me that the system is far from optimal. If you have any tips, I'm always open for improvements.

## The ELLIS doctoral symposium 2021 

EDS is now over and I think we can call it a success. Many PhDs (including me) had never been to a conference before due to the pandemic. While online conferences exist, they offer much less of the informal chats after a poster session or during the breaks. During one of the poster sessions I had a discussion with a bunch of people who work on similar things as I do and in maybe 15 minutes I learned a lot of small stuff that could have accelerated my own research quite a bit, had I known this a year ago. The participants seemed to be mostly happy with the organisation and there actually were no real negative incidences during the event. I'm actually a bit proud that we pulled it off - which is a feeling that I rarely experience. 

TODO figure

However, while the week itself went pretty smoothly, the path towards it was painful in parts. 

#### Finding a venue

For an in-person conference we obviously needed a venue. We set the date to be during the university holidays, so it shouldn't be to complicated to get rooms from the university, right? Due to covid, the university doesn't provide rooms for events with external participants. But we could apply for a special exception to get the rooms. So we applied for the exception which took two weeks to get. The fact that it took "only" two weeks is probably only due to the fact that I called every couple of days and wrote lots of mails. Otherwise we would have likely been forgotten. So now that we have our special permit, it should be easy. The university just provides rooms and we are good to go. Oh what is that? The rooms that usually have a capacity for 500 - 1000 people can't house the 100 participants because of internal covid guidelines? And we can't do any catering anywhere in the university because of fire regulation? Ah, OK so the university is actually not an option and we just wasted a month. 

Well then we just get a private alternative, right? Hold on young cowboy, not so fast. You first have to prove that the university is unable to provide rooms and you have to get three complete offers for a venue. It also doesn't matter, that there are probably not three places which even offer the space for all participants - we have to get three offers!!!. So I basically call every location in Tübingen to get my damn offers, most of which reply with "Dude, we can't host so many participants and it says so on our website", to which I have to reply "Yeah I know, but could you please pretend that you could so I can go to the university to say 'I told you so'?". Unfortunately, most venues didn't do me the favour but I somehow ended up with three offers anyway. Then we took a look at all options and - surprise surprise - found out that the venue we wanted to have anyway was the only realistic option. 

I know this rule has positives as well. In a bigger city, looking for alternative venues probably automatically creates a backup plan when something goes wrong. Furthermore, it can provide additional accountability to prevent abuse. However, my current feeling (after n=1 conferences) is that it does more harm than good as I will argue in the next large section. 

#### Buying small stuff

For a conference you have to buy a lot of small stuff. Some cookies, some snacks, some fruits, some pins, etc. Normally, one would just buy all of those and get reimbursed later. And technically, this is possible in  our system. However, the process is so annoying, that it was always recommended to employ someone for every little thing. Need cookies and snacks? Pay for a caterer. Need pins? Buy them through the office supply of the university instead of the shop around the corner. In the end, we didn't opt for catering for cookies because we are not insane and opted for a strategy, that I will not disclose any further. 

In general, the process of reimbursement and keeping up with everything is so annoying, that I often felt like rather not buying stuff just to stop the annoyance - even when the stuff would be important. 

#### Reimbursing speakers

Speakers have to show that they took the cheapest (reasonable) means of transport to get to the conference. But it's not quite clear how strict you are supposed to be. Coming by train in the second class will be reimbursed even though coming by bus or car sharing would technically be cheaper. But the inconsistency goes further than that. We are allowed to fly someone in from New Zealand for 1000€ as long as they fly economy but we are not allowed to reimburse someone coming from Berlin if they buy a first class ticket for less than 100€. 

I get how we shouldn't fly in speakers in first class, but it's still kind of odd, that there isn't some sort of a lower, e.g. as long as it is below 200€ you can just pay for whatever you want. 

#### Not reimbursing participants

Some people who came to the symposium had to pay travel and accommodation on their own because their university wouldn't pay for them or withdrew their support. Our conferences was running far under the predicted budget so we thought, we might be able to help out the couple of participants that needed it. But, of course, this isn't possible. According to the rules, we are only able to reimburse people whose attendance is critical or of special importance to the event. And of course, while it isn't critical for the event that one particular participant is able to come, the event might be very important to the person who would like to attend. 

And while everyone in academia always wants to be inclusive and helps out those in need, it is nearly impossible to put that into practice without breaking all sorts of rules. 

#### Covid

Once we had a venue, we required to have a covid plan. So we created one according to the instructions in the legislature. The law also states that it is recommended to double check the plan with the local health ministry. In Tübingen, the health department is a sub department of another ministry and can only be called on working days for a maximum of three hours a day. When I finally got through to them after many attempts, they said they are not responsible and I have to call another Ministry. But due to covid the other ministry is overloaded and they won't respond to phone calls. So I send them a mail. After a while they wrote a response along the lines of "Just make your plan according to the instructions of the law and you'll be fine". Which law? The one that send me here and made me waste a week, of course. 

All people I contacted in the different ministries and departments were always nice and helped as much as they could. I'm actually quite surprised about how relaxed and gentle they were after presumably having to deal with weird rules all day. 

## Problems & Solutions

Extrapolating from my experiences, I want to talk a little bit about the systemic problems of this system and possible solutions to them. 

#### Control instead of trust

From my experience, it is very clear that the lawmakers who designed the rules have absolutely zero trust in anyone within the system. For everything you do, there is at least one form you have to fill or other forms of administrative overhead. 

Surely, for large expenses this is reasonable, but is it really necessary for all the small stuff? 

You might be saying that this provides a disincentive for abuse. And this is certainly true to some extent - misappropriating money is harder. But the 5% of people who want to abuse the system will still find a way if they put in the effort. I'm not sure if all the overhead for the 95% of people who just want to organise an event is an appropriate response to the abuse problem. 

Maybe the system is correctly calibrated and I just underestimate the number of people who really want to misappropriate public money. But I still feel like there are ways to implement such a system that are less suboptimal. In private companies, organising an event doesn't require so much overhead because the company has more trust in the person they hired. Also, it is an iterative game, in the sense that you gain or lose your companies trust for the next event. As far as I understand this is currently not the case in academic funding. It doesn't matter how many well-run events you have organised in the past or how shady your track record is. In front of the law, you will be treated the same independently of your track record. 

I'm not sure if it is even possible to change the current system, but I strongly feel like the lack of trust is one of the fundamental reasons why the interaction with it is so painfully annoying. I have organised events (debate tournaments) before but they were all much less annoying because somebody put their trust in me rather than asking for tons of paperwork. I just don't know how to scale this system. 

#### Public funding law doesn't know time

As I alluded to before, you have to fill a form for everything, make lots of phone calls and write lots of emails to get anything done. But the system doesn't only waste my time, it also wastes the time of the people from the ELLIS network who supported me. They had to fill in countless forms and write tons of e-mails as well since every simple request always goes up and down the chain once. 

The thing that hurts me the most is that all of this valuable time could be used accelerate research in the case of the admins or to do research in the case of PhDs. 

#### Loss of money

In the same way in which the system forces you to waste time it forces you to waste money. The admins don't work for free and they shouldn't. I would estimate that the amount of hours that admins had to spend for this project amounts to at least 1/3 of our final budget if it was accounted for. And this doesn't even account for the 12 PhDs who essentially worked for free. Technically, the organisers were supposed to do this during their working hours and not their free time, but event organisation doesn't count nearly as much for your CV as citations do, so sacrificing free time was the rational option. 

Ignoring the salary component, you are even effectively forced to waste money on small stuff. You can't just buy cookies from the store, you can't just buy pins for the pinboards, you have to either get at least three offers, employ a caterer for food, or use the internal office supply. All of these options are obviously much more expensive than just buying stuff on amazon, but at least you prevented nepotism or something.

Once again, this money could be used to do actual research, advance understanding or improve the world directly. 

#### Incentives, incentives, incentives

The question that I was always asking myself is: why? Why is the system designed in this way? I don't think the people in charge are completely irrational and just want to torture some admins. There are reasons for why the system is like it is but they might not be desirable. 

And the answer that I always get is simple: lawmakers get punished for negative cases but no reward for positive cases. I talked to a lawyer who was part of the team that designed the covid rules that we had to follow, I talked to doctors who have to deal with the health ministry and I talked to people in academia. The response is always that someone up the chain is afraid that something could go wrong and thus they install more control. 

And I'm not even personally blaming the people who design the rules. Given the current culture of public relations and promotions it is rational to act like they do. If there is a fuck-up, they are fired. If their rules are efficient and help those who work with them, everyone is mildly happy but they are not necessarily promoted. 

Changing this is hard if not nearly impossible because it is not just a couple of people who have to change their behaviour but the result of a complex interplay of how voters choose politicians, how the media portais success and failure and how responsibility is distributed. If a politician makes academic funding easier and smoother and someone else abuses that, the public narrative is that the rules have to be tightened and the politician should be hanged for their negligence even if the vast majority of admins were more happy with the system. 

#### Does it have to be like this?

I think it's plausible that I underestimate the extent to which people misappropriate public money. Many might "just help a buddy" or use the money to buy unnecessary items as if the money grew on trees. There are tons of stories of corruption up to the highest level. Also, systems like the central government in Germany have laxer rules on transparency and corruption and it gets <a href='https://www.transparency.org/en/countries/germany'>abused</a>. So it feels like some form of regulation is necessary to stop the abuse that would happen in an unregulated system. 

However, I personally feel like that the current system is a problem-solution-mismatch on many levels. Firstly, there is a problem of scope. While it seems to be possible that some politicians fund dubious public projects worth millions of dollars academics waste valuable hours over pennies. 

TODO: check actual science. 

#### People will use alternatives if possible

Since I have organised events for the debate club, I know that it doesn't have to be this complicated. And my suspicion is that private companies and foundations have less complicated systems as well. Thus I would expect organisers to choose a private option whenever possible just to avoid the public system. I certainly wouldn't say no, if some company paid for the event in the future. While this might sound positive in the beginning - after all, the state has to spend less money - events also lose independence. Academic events will have to include some advertisement or do some recruiting or will have to adapt the focus according to whatever the main sponsor desires. I personally think this is a bad development since the entire point of academic conferences is to be as independent as possible. 

## Lessons for the future

There are a lot of things I personally learned and want to share with others in case somebody wants to organise an academic event themselves.

#### I might do it again?!

After all of the above it sounds insane to reconsider doing it, but I might. However, this will only happen if we get a very specific set of conditions. In short - as long as we are allowed to copy and paste this years conference and improve it a bit, I could see myself organising it again. 

#### Get support from admin

If you organise an event that uses public money you have to have someone with experience on your side. If not, you will be hopelessly lost with absolute certainty. If we didn't have people to help us with the forms and finances, the event could not have happened!

#### Delegate much more

If you are the lead organiser, your job is to hold everything together, not to do everything yourself. There are a lot of situations in which you might think "I'll just do it myself, how long could it take?", just to spend a week on a task. You might also feel like an asshole because your fifth friendly reminder for a long overdue task doesn't sound as friendly as your first one. But if you don't delegate and don't sometimes get people to do the work they consented to do, then you will be completely swamped with task very quickly.

As a lead organiser, you are a manager, your job is to have a clear overview of what needs to be done, break it down for your subgroups so that they can work on it. You have to motivate the team and make sure everyone feels good. It is unlikely that you can do all of this if you also work on all tasks on your own. 

## Conclusion

Overall, this experience made me pretty bearish regarding the future of academia. If so much money and time is wasted just to organise a small conference, how bad is the situation for all the people who have to work with the system on a daily basis? The professors and especially the secretaries and admins should use their time to further research and not to fill in forms. Some of the people working with the system surely figures out some shortcuts and fall into less pitfalls than I did, but most people I have talked to agree that the system feels far from optimal. 

I don't exactly know how an optimal system would look like, but, in my opinion, it should a) be more proportional, e.g. small payments require less bureaucracy than large payments, and b) has to give more trust to people or institutions who have already managed projects well in the past. 

If the system stays as it is I expect more and more talent not to bother with academia. This sounds grim, but the sentiment "if you want to do science, don't stay in academia" is very common and I can totally understand why. 

I wish for a reform of funding laws and academia in general where all rules are evaluated by whether they increase scientific output rather than whether some bureaucrat was scared about something that barely happens. After all, I really like science but academic reality sometimes TODO
