## **What is this post about?**

About a year ago I started my PhD in Machine Learning with Philipp Hennig. Over this year, I have changed my mind quite a lot on different issues regarding PhDs. The purpose of this post is to help other people, e.g. if someone is unsure whether to pursue a PhD, and to expose my own approach to feedback from others. So if you think, for example, I could do something better, please reach out and let me know. 

### Mini-overview

Mini-overview of the content of my PhD. 

### Caveats

Big caveat: covid, working alone on a project

I think Philipp is great and so is the group

### A PhD is harder than I expected

PhD is harder than I thought

### Supervisor-Student Relationship

Supervisor student relationship: more initiative and less doing what you are told

### Meetings

Really prepare meetings with Supervisor and gently take control

### Writing a paper

Paper writing
-True, understandable, concise
-Iterate yourself
-make it shorter
-get feedback early on (and give a lot of feedback)

### Academia is even more broken than I expected

Academia is slightly broken

### Picking Projects

Pick projects that you really care about -> say no to a lot of projects
kill your darlings -> look for things that could end the project

### The steady turtle wins the race

Don't take yourself too seriously

Steady turtle wins the race. I don't like deadline stress and I think it's counterproductive.
