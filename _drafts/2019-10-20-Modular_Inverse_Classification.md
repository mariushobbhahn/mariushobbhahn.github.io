**Abstract:**

In my first bachelor thesis I tested whether "inverting" the classification process by using gradient information of generative models is effective. One of the problems turned out to be that the latent space became less structured for larger datasets and the results, therefore, got worse. In a follow-up study, which yields the content of this code, we found that using expert modules alleviates this problem and yields better results on sparse datasets. 

<a href='TODO'>Code</a> for this project is openly available.
