## **What is this post about?**

To keep a <href='https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/305/305779/the-scout-mindset/9780241308325.html'>scout mindset</a>, I try to keep track of beliefs I changed. This not only serves as a reminder that I regularly change beliefs but also reveals the underlying reason for them. Check out <a href='https://www.mariushobbhahn.com/2020-05-10-Opinion_change/'>part I</a> and <a href='https://www.mariushobbhahn.com/2021-04-24-opinion_change_2/'>part II</a> to get an overview of previous changes.

As in the previous edition, I will not only mention things that I had an explicit opinion that I then changed but also write about beliefs that I find helpful in general. 

## Personal

#### Doubling down on EA & Neoliberalism

I've been an EA since late 2015 and it has always been a strong part of my identity. However, at some point over the last two years I had a simple realisation that made me really double down on it. I noticed that I buy the premise of EA, e.g. "If you believe helping matters you should do so in the most effective way possible" completely. There was no doubt left that it could be somehow incorrect. The rest then just followed like a corolary, I wrote more posts, I hopped on more projects, went to even more EA events and basically spend all of my free time engaging with it and currently try focus more on AI alignment in my PhD. And I regret absolutely nothing! 

As an edgy teenager I used to like the narrative that "we shouldn't be so narrow minded about other cultures" and "other political systems can be good too". While there might be a spark of truth to that, I now think the West got it mostly right. Liberal democracies that hold individual freedoms high and only curb them when necessary to protect others, e.g. in a pandemic are probably the best political system we currently have. Similarly, social market economies are the best economic system we currently have. We can discuss the details (see next question) but when compared to other historically tested systems, they are just better. I have not only strengthened this belief, it has also become part of my identity. When the West binds together to fight against Russia or when dictators are replaced by young democracies it's not just the news, it's a win for the team! 

#### Most people are have too little rather than too much ambition

See 80k. 

#### You don't need permission to suggest improvements

#### I want to be replaced

I sometimes catch myself trying to status quo for no appearent reason

#### Mental health is a trade-off

I think it's really great that people care about their mental health, that social awareness is rising and that employers start to understand that. Most people are probably still underfocusing on mental health rather then overfocusing. However, I think some people overdo this narrative. Sometimes you hear things like "mental health always comes first" and I disagree. In my opinion, mental health interventions should be focused on preventing and treating downsides and less on trying to create large upsides. Most things in life are trade-offs and I think mental health belongs to them. In many cases, it might not be worth to invest the time and energy to marginally improve your happiness because there are better uses of your time. 

To prevent misunderstandings, I want to emphasise that I endorse people going to therapy and engage in preventative measures. But I think it is completely fine for someone to say "I work longer to get more done even if it makes me less happy".  This may sound like a controversial opinion to some but I'd expect this to be the default opinion in society.

#### Nootropics

I had a strong vitamin D deficiency last year and I probably have a light version of seasonal affective disorder. This lead me to investigate supplements more. I started with Vitamin D supplements and quickly went down the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic'>Nootropics</a> (cognitive enhancers) rabbit hole. I tried a bunch of them (but small sample size) and my conclusions so far are
1. **Most didn't do anything for me**: 
2. **Some have measurable effects**: 
3. **It's just marginal gains**: Even in the best case, Nootropics won't carry your productivity. Focusing on good sleep, having good project management and other basics have a higher impact than finding the right Nootropic---at least for me so far. 

#### Improvements and suffering

#### Exposition works insanely well

#### Everyone is "just some dude"

Sorry for the gendered language but I didn't find a good alternative. 

#### Gene editing



#### MDMA is really good (hypothetically)

MDMA is illegal in most countries, so as a law abiding citizen I would, of course, never take it. But let's engage in the hypothetical case in which I took it. In this hypothetical, I would have really enjoyed the experience, have been really happy for about 6 hours in which I felt a very strong sense of connection with my friends without any negative side effects. The experience would have been so good, that it changed some beliefs of mine in major ways. It would have made me more bullish on how easily one can positively alter their state of mind, how large the genetic differences of happiness setpoints between people could be and how good future generations could feel once we figure out how to to reliable increase our happiness setpoint, e.g. through gene-editing. Furthermore, it would have made me question my risk aversion towards mind-altering experiences and nudge me towards doing more of them in the future. Unfortunately, this is just a hypothetical and thus, I came to none of these conclusions. 

#### Moving to the US

Couldn't imagine -> really want to try. 

#### Frontloading life

to get a PhD people want you to already have one. To get a grant people want to already see the results. start-ups. applying for a job. 

## Relationships

#### The female orgasm is much better

#### Talk about everything

#### More exploration

Exploreation exploitation

#### Improving sexlife

vibrator, communicate a lot, get some feedback, talk to others. 

## Political

#### Slightly more technocracy

I used to think that technocracy was a superior form of government in nearly all aspects. It just seemed weird to me that the median opinion could be better than that of experts. And I still think this is mostly true. However, I updated on a bunch of things
1. Experts are no saints. They have their own personal goals, they have biases and they like people in their tribe. If a technocratic government is implemented just the right way, they will create better outcomes but they are much less robust to disturbances and less self-correcting than democracies. Their upsides can be higher but so can their downsides.
2. Good decisions are often meaningless without the buy-in of the population. A mask mandate or a lock down only makes sense when the people wear a mask or stay home. If they don't understand or disagree, the perfect policy in a vacuum just doesn't stick. 
3. However, this doesn't mean that democracies are perfect and I still much prefer a representative over a direct democracy. People systematically vote against their own long-term self-interest in questions of economics and immigration and e.g. questions of interest rates or immigration policy should just be left to the economists. People have a bad track record of 

#### Underpopulation is a bigger problem than overpopulation



## Economic

#### GDP matters a lot

I often hear this sentiment that "GPD doesn't matter after a certain point" or that "GDP doesn't describe how people actually feel" and I agree that GDP has some downsides. It doesn't capture everything we care about and it likely never will. However, I'm ever more convinced that these criticism are very small to the benefits of using GPD as a metric and trying to increase it. This is for multiple reasons.
1. GDP is the best available approximation to value and wealth. GDP essentially captures how much people value the things in the economy by how much they are willing to pay for them. It's not just some weird number, it really captures something we care about. 
2. It's **the** prime example of a positive-sum game. 


#### Land value tax!!

#### Nuclear power

#### Urban planning
