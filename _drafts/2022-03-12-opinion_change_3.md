## **What is this post about?**

To keep a <href='https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/305/305779/the-scout-mindset/9780241308325.html'>scout mindset</a>, I try to keep track of beliefs I changed. This not only serves as a reminder that I regularly change beliefs but also reveals the underlying reason for them. Check out <a href='https://www.mariushobbhahn.com/2020-05-10-Opinion_change/'>part I</a> and <a href='https://www.mariushobbhahn.com/2021-04-24-opinion_change_2/'>part II</a> to get an overview of previous changes.

As in the previous edition, I will not only mention things that I had an explicit opinion that I then changed but also write about beliefs that I find helpful in general. 

## Personal

#### Doubling down on EA & Neoliberalism

I've been an EA since late 2015 and it has always been a strong part of my identity. However, at some point over the last two years I had a simple realisation that made me really double down on it. I noticed that I buy the premise of EA, e.g. "If you believe helping matters you should do so in the most effective way possible" completely. There was no doubt left that it could be somehow incorrect. The rest then just followed like a corolary, I wrote more posts, I hopped on more projects, went to even more EA events and basically spend all of my free time engaging with it. I'm currently pivoting my PhD to AI alignment. So I guess I just went all in on EA. So far, I regret absolutely nothing! Actually, it feels really good!

As an edgy teenager I used to like the narrative that "we shouldn't be so narrow minded about other cultures" and "other political systems can be good too". While there might be a spark of truth to that, I now think the West got it mostly right. Liberal democracies that hold individual freedoms high and only curb them when necessary to protect others, e.g. in a pandemic are probably the best political system we currently have. Similarly, social market economies are the best economic system we currently have. We can discuss the details (see next question) but when compared to other historically tested systems, they are just better. I have not only strengthened this belief, it has also become part of my identity. When the West binds together to fight against Russia or when dictators are replaced by young democracies it's not just the news, it's a win for the team! 

#### I want to be replaced

I sometimes catch myself clinging to my current identity even if it is objectively bad, e.g. I think "I'm just a person who is bad at X". I think this is a self-fulfilling prophecy and it prevents us from improving faster. Therefore, I want to clearly commit to a mantra of not clinging to my current identity. I want to want to be replaced (see <a href='https://www.mariushobbhahn.com/2022-03-08-replace_me/'>here</a> for full version). 

#### Exposition works insanely well

I was honestly very surprised how good exposition works in my academic and the EA community. By exposition I mean publishing blog posts, writing in different forums, posting stuff on Twitter and so on. I expected to get a bit of interaction and some casual conversations but it turned out to be much more. I regularly got helpful feedback on my posts from people I didn't know before, some important life opportunities only came due to the existence of my blog, some discussions on Twitter have lead to research projects and some of our group posts on the EA forum have drawn the attention of some bigger names in the community. 

I guess I previously overestimated how much work was necessary to create relevant output. It went from "literally unachievable by a mere mortal like me" to "20 hours of focused investment is more than enough to write a valuable post".  Furthermore, I think I underestimated how effectively messages spread around. I guess the Twitter algorithm does a lot of legwork here and recommendations spread fast in human networks. Somehow, my posts sometimes ended up with people who I definitley didn't think of when writing them. 

#### Everyone is "just some dude"

Sorry for the gendered language but I didn't find a good alternative word with the same vibe as dude. I had this realization in multiple situations. When supreme court justices show insanely low mathematical skills, when professors sometimes make very basic mistakes or when someone who I idolize for their work shows low social skills. Every time the realization hits me again---they are just some dude. They might be really good at some things but bad and others, they are victims of the same cognitive biases as other people and their communication isn't magically perfect. 

I think this makes it easier to approach the people you idolize and easier to understand why and when they mess up. 

#### Mental health is a trade-off

I think it's really great that people care about their mental health, that social awareness is rising and that employers start to understand that. Most people are probably still underfocusing on mental health rather then overfocusing. However, I think some people overdo this narrative. Sometimes you hear things like "mental health always comes first" and I disagree. In my opinion, mental health interventions should be focused on preventing and treating downsides and less on trying to create large upsides. Most things in life are trade-offs and I think mental health belongs to them. In many cases, it might not be worth to invest the time and energy to marginally improve your happiness because there are better uses of your time. 

To prevent misunderstandings, I want to emphasise that I endorse people going to therapy and engage in preventative measures. But I think it is completely fine for someone to say "I work longer to get more done even if it makes me less happy".  This may sound like a controversial opinion to some but I'd expect this to be the default opinion in society.

#### It's really hard to build a team but it's easy to destroy it

Hiring / building a team is one thing that I drastically underestimated. Some beliefs that changed include
1. **Combinatorial explosion**: There are a lot of explicit or implicit conditions for a position. You want the person to be good at the task (which are often multiple conditions), you want them to fit the current team, you want them to have good social skills, and so on. With every additional criterium your pool gets drastically smaller. So even if you have 100 applicants, there is a decent chance nobody will fit all criteria. 
2. **It's easy to destroy a good team:** If the ratio of junior to senior people is too high, the senior people will be overworked and some might leave. This amplifies the problem and might lead to the collapse of the team. Furthermore, it often takes just one person to destroy a good team. This might be a person that doesn't comprehend at the same rate as the rest of the team, talks too much, holds inefficient meetings, etc. As soon as this happens the best people leave to form a new team. 
3. **It's hard to keep up morale:** Even if you found a good team, some things might go wrong, there might be infighting, there might be substantial disagreements or the vibe just feels off. A perfectly good team could be ruined by small things so it makes sense to invest substantially in good vibes in the team. 

The consequences of this are a) that I can totally understand why hiring processes take long, b) I now see it as a good sign when companies want to make really sure that you are a good fit because it implies that the rest of the team is good and c) once I'm in a position where I hire myself, I will try to not rush it because of the large possible downsides of suboptimal hires. 

#### MDMA is really good (hypothetically)

MDMA is illegal in most countries, so as a law abiding citizen I would, of course, never take it. But let's engage in the hypothetical case in which I took it. In this hypothetical, I would have really enjoyed the experience, have been really happy for about 6 hours in which I felt a very strong sense of connection with my friends without any negative side effects. The experience would have been so good, that it changed some beliefs of mine in major ways. It would have made me more bullish on how easily one can positively alter their state of mind, how large the genetic differences of happiness setpoints between people could be and how good future generations could feel once we figure out how to to reliable increase our happiness setpoint, e.g. through gene-editing. Furthermore, it would have made me question my risk aversion towards mind-altering experiences and nudge me towards doing more of them in the future. Unfortunately, this is just a hypothetical and thus, I came to none of these conclusions. 

#### Moving to the US

Two or three years ago, I couldn't really imagine living in the USA. The country is politically polarized, crime rates are way higher than in Europe, health care bills can drown you in debt, race relations seem bad from the outside , cities are build around cars and have bad bike infrastructure and much more. However, I have heard many people who are very bullish on living in the US. For them the Bay Area, Miami or New York are the best place on earth by far and I trust some of the enough to be very curious. Furthermore, the EA and AI safety scene is very strong in the Bay Area. 

All of this makes me really want to try out living there at least for a while. 

#### Frontloading life

I have witnessed a lot of situations to where to get something you have to already have it. To get into a PhD program people want you to have extensive research experience, i.e. the thing you are supposed to get during a PhD. To get a grant, people want you to have results already, i.e. the thing you want to get with the grant. If you want to start a start-up people want to see a product, i.e. the thing you want to develop. If you apply for a job, people want you to be good at the job already.  Of course, this doesn't apply to everyone---many VCs or grant makers are realistic about this. However, sometimes you will have to deal with people that have these kind of expectations. 

My experience is that it really pays off to find out what kind of expectations these are and try to build credible evidence for them. This usually comes with some financial or time investment upfront (thus frontloading life) but it can meaningfully increase your chances of success. If you are currently not in such a situation it helps to put away some money in case the preparation period takes longer. 

There is a more abstract notion here that doing things that make sense before you are explicitly asked to can really pay off. For example, if you write on a post with other people it helps to add suggestions or refine the text before you are explicitly asked to. You should, of course, only do these things if you are relatively sure that the rest of the group wants this. In case you are unsure, just ask. 

Most of this point can be summarized as "be more like Hermine Granger" and is not a major update for you but I find the framing helpful anyway. 

#### Improvements and suffering

I always find motivational statements a la "just put your head down and hussle" or "no pain, no gain" rather amusing. I think that a lot of pain/annoyance is not necessary for improvement and could be prevented by better management or a different frame of mind. For example, learning a language with a book is less fun than with duo lingo but not necessarily more effective. In this case, the app is just the superior alternative. I used to think that most improvements can be like this, e.g. there is an option that is superior in most aspects and doesn't imply suffering/annoyance. While I still think this could be technically true, I don't think it is realistic. 

If you want to get good at something it usually requires pushing existing limits, investing a lot of time to understand something or just put in some work to get there. Expending resources on something that isn't survival or reproduction is an evolutionary disadvantage so it only makes sense that we are hardwired to feel bad about it. I still think there are clearly superior strategies but I now expect even those to come with some pain that is worth trading off in some cases. 

#### Nootropics

I had a strong vitamin D deficiency last year and I probably have a light version of seasonal affective disorder. This lead me to investigate supplements more. I started with Vitamin D supplements and quickly went down the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nootropic'>Nootropics</a> (cognitive enhancers) rabbit hole. I tried a bunch of them (but small sample size) and my conclusions so far are
1. **Most didn't do anything for me**: 
2. **Some have measurable effects**: 
3. **It's just marginal gains**: Even in the best case, Nootropics won't carry your productivity. Focusing on good sleep, having good project management and other basics have a higher impact than finding the right Nootropic---at least for me so far. 

TODO mention gwern and scott alexander.

#### Gene editing

I was above average bullish on gene editing. However, since there is such a strong opposition to gene editing in plants, animals and humans, I decided to dig in to understand their arguments. I was astonished by what I found. The opposition's arguments were way worse than I expected and often rely on misinformation and very weird trade-offs. The proponents arguments, on the other hand, were even stronger than expected, e.g. by increasing yields of different plants by 2 or 3 times. You can find my detailed post <a href='https://www.mariushobbhahn.com/2022-01-20-genetic_enhancements/'>here</a>. 

## Relationships

#### The female orgasm is much better

From my limited number of sexual experiences, it seems like the female orgasm is longer and more intense than what I'm experiencing. All male and female friends I have talked to about this have similar intuitions. Doesn't have any major implications---maybe, that dating utilitarians might be in women's self interest. 

#### Talk about everything

I was always a big fan of talking about everything in a relationship but I have further double-downed on that after reading <a href='https://www.amazon.de/Pragmatists-Guide-Relationships-Ruthlessly-Strategies-ebook/dp/B08D6CGQHQ'>The pragmatist's guide to relationships</a>. In my opinion, both partners should always feel like they could talk about a hard question and expect to get help from their partner. If you ever feel like your partner "just would understand" or "find it weird" that is a sign you should talk about your communication standards. The space of allowed topics should really range from "I think I have a crush on someone else" over "I might want to live in a different country" to "I want to try an unconventional sexual thing". 

Of course, they way in which you communicate still matters a lot. You should want to communicate constructively, signal that you want to get to a good conclusion, and so forth. This stance does not give you permission to be mean or break communication norms "because you are allowed to say everything". 

My reasoning for this stance is as follows. If you intend to lead a long-term relationship, your partner will be the person you trust the most. If you don't trust them to deal well with your most intimate thoughts, you might not want to spend a substantial part of your life with them. If you think the relationship is only temporary the stakes are lower and it's easier to be fully honest. 

#### More exploration to find a longterm partner

Also inspired by <a href='https://www.amazon.de/Pragmatists-Guide-Relationships-Ruthlessly-Strategies-ebook/dp/B08D6CGQHQ'>The pragmatist's guide to relationships</a> I now think that there should be much more exploration to find a longterm partner than is common. If your goal is to find a long-term relationship, it is worth systematically exploring. In the book they suggest that going on more than 100 first dates is a good heuristic. Should I return to the dating market, I'll try such a strategy. These 100 people are, of course, not randomly selected but pre-selected by algorithms or a specific location. 

#### Improving sexlife

I think the default secrecy about sex means that most people's sexlife could easily be improved. 
1. **Communicate a lot.** Your partner can't look into your head and preferences vary a lot between people. Thus, the fastest way to make them understand what you want is to tell them. This can include relatively detailed micromanagement from time to time, e.g. "more like this, faster, slower, etc.". Detailed communication should also not be interpreted as removing your partners agency but as a sign of trust that pays off very quickly. 
2. **Talk to your friends about sex.** You don't need to provide a detailed account of what you are doing but sharing broad insights is already helpful. I think it's kind of weird that we are happy to tell our friends how to get better at cooking, sports, video games, etc. but rarely about sex. 
3. **Use technology.** A vibrator doesn't replace you, it frees one hand. 

## Political

#### The military



#### Slightly more technocracy

I used to think that technocracy was a superior form of government in nearly all aspects. It just seemed weird to me that the median opinion could be better than that of experts. And I still think this is mostly true. However, I updated on a bunch of things
1. **Experts are no saints.** They have their own personal goals, they have biases and they like people in their tribe. If a technocratic government is implemented just the right way, they will create better outcomes but they are much less robust to disturbances and less self-correcting than democracies. Their upsides can be higher but so can their downsides.
2. **Good decisions are often meaningless without the buy-in of the population.** A mask mandate or a lock down only makes sense when the people wear a mask or stay home. If they don't understand or disagree, the perfect policy in a vacuum just doesn't stick. 
3. However, this doesn't mean that democracies are perfect and I still much prefer a representative over a direct democracy. People systematically vote against their own long-term self-interest in questions of economics and immigration and e.g. questions of interest rates or immigration policy should just be left to the economists. People have a bad track record of caring about future people, e.g. pandemics, or caring about people in other parts of the world, e.g. foreign aid. So my rule of thumb is "the more complex and the further away from people's direct lives a topic is, the bigger the proportion of expert influence vs. people's influence". 

#### Underpopulation vs. overpopulation

In school we were taught about population growth and resource scarcities along the lines of "if every person lived like the average Western person, we would require 3 worlds". I think resource use is a problem but the focus should be on better distribution and more efficient mechanisms than by reducing the number of people. For example, if more people would be vegetarian or vegan, there would be drastically less land use for agriculture and much more people could be fed than live today. If we sped up the deployment of renewables, energy scarcity wouldn't be much of a problem. 

On the other hand, I think underpopulation is a real problem. This belief was influences by <a href='https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Matthew-Yglesias-ebook/dp/B082ZR6827'>One Billion Americans</a> where Matthew Yglesias makes the case that more people=more growth=more power which is simply but true. Furthermore, the belief was influenced by the Our world in data graph on fertility which seems to be shrinking much faster than I expected. 

TODO graph

My high-level conclusion from all of this is two-fold: a) underpopulation is at least as concerning as overpopulation. b) More people is a relatively save way to get to the future faster (more innovation, etc.). Whether we want that, I'm not entirely sure yet. 

#### Policy design matters a lot

I think finding a good policy goal is already hard. You need to balance interests, find compromises, etc. However, one part of the policy pipeline that I find highly underrated are the nitty gritty details of its exact design. For example, whether a child benefit comes in form of a transaction to your bank account or a tax benefit seems irrelevant on paper but results in two completely different realities. Wealthy, literate native speakers will get the money either way but people who are less fortunate or non-natives might not understand what they have to do or even know that the policy exists. Another example would be opt-in vs. opt-out solutions to e.g. organ donations. On paper the people who want to donate their organs do it either way but in practice, the two systems result in <20% vs. > 95% participation. This one seemingly irrelevant paragraph in the law translates to thousands of lives saved or not saved. 

Getting the right goals is one thing but executing it correctly is a whole new problem that lawmakers seem to only slowly catch up on in many areas. 

## Economic

#### GDP matters a lot

I often hear this sentiment that "GPD doesn't matter after a certain point" or that "GDP doesn't describe how people actually feel" and I agree that GDP has some downsides. It doesn't capture everything we care about and it likely never will. However, I'm ever more convinced that these criticism are very small to the benefits of using GPD as a metric and trying to increase it. This is for multiple reasons.
1. GDP is the best available approximation to **value and wealth**. GDP essentially captures how much people value the things in the economy by how much they are willing to pay for them. It's not just some weird number, it really captures something we care about. 
2. Economic growth is **the** prime example of a positive-sum game. It sounds too good to be true but everyone can get richer in real terms, i.e. controlling for inflation and purchasing power. Of course, that doesn't mean that the wealth is correctly distributed around the globe but the fact that everyone gets richer is already mind boggling to me. 
3. **GDP is power**. Why can the West sanction Russia? Why do people want to move to the West? There are, of course, many answers to these questions but first and foremost, because the West is rich. The EU's economy will tank less than Russias and people want to come here because they want to participate in our economy (and we should let them in!). 

#### Land value tax!!

I didn't know what a land value tax (LVT) is but some of my friends who I trust to have good judgement were really excited about it. So when TODO:link wrote a piece on it, I wanted to understand what all the buzz is about---and I completely understand it now. In short, a LVT taxes a high proportion of the value of land. This simple ideas has a bunch of really nice implications.
1. **It forces you to use the land efficiently.** If you want to keep your extra garden plot in a high rent area, be prepared to pay a lot of money for the privilege. The space should be used to build houses in which many people live and thrive and your extra garden should be outside of the city where land is less valuable. 
2. **It doesn't create negative incentives:** Most taxes create negative incentives. An income tax reduces the value of work, a wealth tax reduces the value of wealth creation, a value-added tax reduces the value of production & consumption, etc. The LVT doesn't have this problem. Therefore, if states had more income through an LVT, they would have to take less taxes from other taxes which would unburden tax payers by paying less and by having better incentives. 

There are, of course, more pros, cons and technical questions with the LVT that you can read up TODO:link. But I think the idea is a very clean way to solve some major social problems and we should at least give it a try.

#### Nuclear power

See post with samu.

#### Urban planning#

TODO: links

I used to think that housing/urban planning is boring and doesn't really matter. Now I think it's exciting and REALLY important. My two main influences were
1. **Not just bikes:** a Youtube channel that talks about urban planning in a very direct but terribly effective way. Some of his videos are along the lines of "This is how it is to live/walk/bike in a good city (Amsterdam). This is how it is to live/walk/bike in a bad city (random US city). See the difference?". After such a video, there is no doubt left in me that some city designs are just superior in all aspects and that most countries should be more like the Netherlands---I have been orange-pilled. 
2. **The housing theory of everything**. I first heard of the theory on the neoliberal podcast and it mainly states that housing has a really big influence on a lot of relevant things. Expensive housing has social justice implications since poorer people can't afford them, it has economic implications since a bigger part of the salary goes into rent which doesn't directly produce anything, it has political implications since it gives more power to home owners and much more. 

TODO links and conclusion.
