## **What is this post about?**

Depends on what "getting rid of" means. Emotions and feelings are definitely not a good proxy for your system 2 goals. 


## Where do Feelings come from? 

Evolution

Social Expectations

## Which Feelings are bad?

Most emotions are good if used correctly. Sometimes it even makes sense to actively get triggered (see MJ); But some feelings are just not aligned with your true system II goals. 

Anger, Jealousy, Sorrow (to an extent), guilt, disgust, 

## How to Remove or Diminish the Impact of certain Feelings?

Think about your emotions and commit to a reaction

Simulate a situation to train your response 

Commit publicly and have a partner to keep yourself accountable

## Conclusions
