## **What is this post about?**

The change of variable for probability density functions (pdfs) is a simple yet powerful fact about probability distributions. It is the foundation for some of my research, which is why I feel comfortable writing this tutorial, but it is also the main component of other ML techniques such as normalizing flows. 

In this post I introduce the change of variable with increasingply complex examples while primarily focusing on visual interpretations.

If you have constructive feedback don't hesitate to write me. If you like it, think about sharing it with others.

## Change of variable for pdfs

Equation

what do the parts mean

interpretation: stretching underlying space like a wire

Following: multiple cases for transformations

### Gaussian x -> 2x


### Gamma x -> log x


### Chi-square -> Gaussian
