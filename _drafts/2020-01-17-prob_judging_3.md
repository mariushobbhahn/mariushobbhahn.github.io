This post is not yet finished. I am still gathering feedback. You can read it anyway if you like but it will likely change a bit in the near future. 

## What is this mini-series about?


## Agreement about the metric

reuse the american dream remittances example.

## Disagreement about the metric

we can still use the american dream but enter the realm of desert and a societal vs. individual component. maybe just choose a different example.

## Limitations of the model:

burdens? 
meeting the right comparative?
doing a weighing better than other teams

## Conclusion

debating is very inconsistent

## Nerd section: some statistical explanations 

- Bayes rule not bayes theorem:
- Distributions are beta, gamma and normal.
- combination: not sampling, multiplied with expected value.

## Acknowledgements
