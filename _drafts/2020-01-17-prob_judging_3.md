This post is not yet finished. I am still gathering feedback. You can read it anyway if you like but it will likely change a bit in the near future. 

## What is this mini-series about?


## Limitations of the model:

burdens? 
meeting the right comparative?
doing a weighing better than other teams

## Nerd section: some statistical explanations 

- Bayes rule not bayes theorem:
- Distributions are beta, gamma and normal.

***One last note:***

If you have any feedback regarding anything (i.e. layout or opinions) please tell me in a constructive manner via your preferred means of communication.
