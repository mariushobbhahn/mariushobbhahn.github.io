## **What is this post about?**

I have recently tried to increase my productivity. And while there are tons of guides out there TODO:list of guids that promise to increase your productivity most of them don't even define what they mean by productivity. Due to this absence of a clear concept many of these hints optimize a rather local and short-termist perspective of productivity that might be intuitive but is IMO not optimizing the true goal once you think about it for a bit longer. 

In this blogpost I want to do two things: a) Justify a definition of productivity from which I derive high-level actions to improve it and b) review the exististing literature and condense the more localized tips and tricks that can improve our everyday workflow. 

Recommendations: Not ... Yes ...

## Definition

The image that I had in my head when I intuitively thought about productivity was very much based on a short-term satisfaction of emotions. It was one where I got up in the morning, immediatly started working, my hands flying over the keyboard solving task after task and ticking all boxes on my todo-list. After the an entire day of work I go to bed filled with contempt since I have completed so many tasks and looking forward to repeat the same process in the following days. While this is slightly exaggerated, people I have spoken to have a similar intuition. However, I think that this framing has three major problems: a) It is clearly not realistic. Your body has limits and most tasks are actually complicated. If you are just ticking boxes all day, you should look for harder problems to solve. b) It focuses on the wrong target. The just described intuition implicitely focuses on the emotional satisfaction from ticking boxes but does not measure the actual outcome of your work. You can tick boxes all day and feel good about it without actually getting anything done and, inversely, you can get a lot done by asking one simple question to the right person even though this might not feel emotionally appealing at all. c) It is too short-termist. While it definitely feels nice to ride on the emotional high for a while this definition doesn't ask simple yet important questions like "How long can you endure this kind of behaviour?" or "Is it actually the optimal way to reach a long-term target?".

In contrast I want to propose a different view of productivity which might be more boring but captures the desired aspects better. I define productivity as the sum of outcomes that can be attributed to your actions over time. Because this sounds very abstract, I want to elaborate on the three main components. 
Firstly, it focuses on outcomes not on the amount of time spend on something. While you will get a better outcome if you invest more time this isn't always the case. If I am able to solve one homework exercise in an hour but my friend solved three in the same timespan, I would say they were more productive than I was. I would even support this claim in extreme cases. Assume, for example, there is scientist A who works all their life to solve a particular problem but never achieves it. One day scientist B looks at the problem, thinks about it for 5 minutes and solves it. Then we intuitively think that scientist A has worked really hard and it would be unfair to claim that scientist B was more productive. But if we compared machine A which makes 1 widget per hour and machine B which makes 1000 widgets per hour, there would be no doubt that machine B is more productive. I also think that most people in real life already agree with the notion that productivity is not equal to the strength of the intention put into the process. If you had an employee that works 80 hours a week with best intentions but gets done only half as much as another person who only works 40 hours you would not promote the first one. 
The second component is the attribution to your actions. I think that this is the weakest link of my definition because it is very hard or impossible to assign credit for the causal contribution of everyone working towards a product. Maybe your contribution is only possible because someone else did research before you or maybe a product could only be made because two individuals worked together but would be impossible if either of them was missing. However, the goal of this post is to think about a concept and not to derive a universally optimal measurement for productivity so I don't think not having a perfect mathematical solution for credit assignment is a problem. 
The third component is that of time. I think this directly follows from the outcome-orientation of my definition. If you want to produce as much outcome as possible there is no reason to work like crazy now, burn out and repeat. Rather you should work as much as you can sustain over a long period of time. Of course, you can also balance this with other interests. I don't suggest your life should be entirely focused around work. 

## Framing

While thinking about productivity I found that sports are a fitting analogy and help to make some aspects clearer. Both sports and productivity is limited by physical constaints. There is a certain amount you can do per week and it is probably less than the amount of time you are awake. Both are trainable and require active effort for improvements. Getting rid of our bad habits, improving our work routines, changing our frame of mind and reducing our procrastination are all skills that don't come over night. Rather, similar to sports, you have to get better step by step but will likely see tangible improvements over time once you put in some effort. Especially endurance sports require the correct pacing and so does productivity. If your goal was to run a marathon you wouldn't start sprinting from the start line and similarly if you wanted to reach a long-term goal and start by workin 80 hours a week you will very likely not keep up that effort. Lastly, different strategies for training show different effectiveness. In sports you can overtrain or you can train for the wrong task, e.g. only doing sprints while training for a marathon. 

Before we get into the details of implementation, I think it is very important to further frame what productivity is and how we should think about it to actually achieve more in less time while feeling good. 

TODO: productivity doesn't necessetate suffering; quite the opposite - frees up time, feels good, more choices;

TODO: don't be guilt driven; working yourself ragged is not a virtue.

TODO: productivity doesn't only include work. Could be exercise, books, healthier lifestyle, etc.  Different levels of optimization: 40 - 80h workweek

TODO: atomic changes, forming habits, marginal gains

TODO: identity not outcome based change

TODO: Don't optimize for the short-term, consistency, plot of "academia workload setting", play the long game


## Implementation

Note: Tricks and rules to break bad habits and designed for the not-so-smart part of our brain. 

### 1. Conditions 

Physical conditions: sleep and fitness; mental conditions: short-term gratification, limited band-width

### 2. Environments

d) Surroundings: optimize for productivity, e.g. right lighting (f.lux, daylight lamp), fresh air, right seating position and ergonomic chairs, split work and rest place, find yourself in groups that are productive

### 3. Clearly Identify your Goal

1. Find your goal; key result areas (what are you hired for?); Mountain analogy; Don't overoptimize for your goal: focus on system once you defined your goal. commit to process

### 4. Prioritize, a lot!!

2. prioritize hard, 80:20 rule, all levels, re-evaluate from time to time, most important first, drop low-value tasks that keep you busy but don't get results; ABCDE

3. Planing. Plan long-term, Planning fallacy; preparation; slice and dice; start now; action intention; start habit by small first steps; 

4. Outsource and delegate; say no to everything that is not vital to achieving your current goal; say no nicely but firmly; outsource through alarms, calenders, notetaking, etc.; don't spread over too many tools; 2-minute rule of action.

5. Procrastinate wisely; active not passive; 

6. Evaluation; yourself and feedbacok from others; weekly reviews, etc.; project-based reviews; 

7. Clear communication; communicate priorities to others

8. Upgrade key skills; never stop learning; 

9. Identify key constraints; identify what's stopping you from your goal; identify bad habits by writing down whatever you currently do; invert the good habit rules (see atomic habits)

10. Pressure; deadlines; positive mental attitude

11. Technology; Remove distraction; prioritize hard; good helper if used correctly.

12. Sessions; 90 min work, 15 min break

13. No multitasking

14. Always ask "what is the next action?"

15. Improve your basic skills: analytics, math backgrounds, coding, etc. 

16. connect things that you want to do with things that you should do. 

17. reframe your beliefs and baselines, e.g. wheelchair

18. Put in your reps

19. short-term gratification for long-term rewards

20. accountability partners & contracts

21. new homunculus

22. Set realistic expectations

23. Account for your flaws: Pretend actions are not stoppable: https://mindingourway.com/where-coulds-go/
