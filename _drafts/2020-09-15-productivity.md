## **What is this post about?**

I have recently tried to increase my productivity. And while there are tons of guides out there TODO:list of guids that promise to increase your productivity most of them don't even define what they mean by productivity. Due to this absence of a clear concept many of these hints optimize a rather local and short-termist perspective of productivity that might be intuitive but is IMO not optimizing the true goal once you think about it for a bit longer. 

In this blogpost I want to do two things: a) Justify a definition of productivity from which I derive high-level actions to improve it and b) review the exististing literature and condense the more localized tips and tricks that can improve our everyday workflow. 

## Definition

The image that I had in my head when I intuitively thought about productivity was very much based on a short-term satisfaction of emotions. It was one where I got up in the morning, immediatly started working, my hands flying over the keyboard solving task after task and ticking all boxes on my todo-list. After the an entire day of work I go to bed filled with contempt since I have completed so many tasks and looking forward to repeat the same process in the following days. While this is slightly exaggerated, people I have spoken to have a similar intuition. However, I think that this framing has three major problems: a) It is clearly not realistic. Your body has limits and most tasks are actually complicated. If you are just ticking boxes all day, you should look for harder problems to solve. b) It focuses on the wrong target. The just described intuition implicitely focuses on the emotional satisfaction from ticking boxes but does not measure the actual outcome of your work. You can tick boxes all day and feel good about it without actually getting anything done and, inversely, you can get a lot done by asking one simple question to the right person even though this might not feel emotionally appealing at all. c) It is too short-termist. While it definitely feels nice to ride on the emotional high for a while this definition doesn't ask simple yet important questions like "How long can you endure this kind of behaviour?" or "Is it actually the optimal way to reach a long-term target?".

In contrast I want to propose a different view of productivity which might be more boring but captures the desired aspects better. I define productivity as the sum of outcomes that can be attributed to your actions over time. Because this sounds very abstract, I want to elaborate on the three main components. 
Firstly, it focuses on outcomes not on the amount of time spend on something. While you will get a better outcome if you invest more time this isn't always the case. If I am able to solve one homework exercise in an hour but my friend solved three in the same timespan, I would say they were more productive than I was. I would even support this claim in extreme cases. Assume, for example, there is scientist A who works all their life to solve a particular problem but never achieves it. One day scientist B looks at the problem, thinks about it for 5 minutes and solves it. Then we intuitively think that scientist A has worked really hard and it would be unfair to claim that scientist B was more productive. But if we compared machine A which makes 1 widget per hour and machine B which makes 1000 widgets per hour, there would be no doubt that machine B is more productive. I also think that most people in real life already agree with the notion that productivity is not equal to the strength of the intention put into the process. If you had an employee that works 80 hours a week with best intentions but gets done only half as much as another person who only works 40 hours you would not promote the first one. 
The second component is the attribution to your actions. I think that this is the weakest link of my definition because it is very hard or impossible to assign credit for the causal contribution of everyone working towards a product. Maybe your contribution is only possible because someone else did research before you or maybe a product could only be made because two individuals worked together but would be impossible if either of them was missing. However, the goal of this post is to think about a concept and not to derive a universally optimal measurement for productivity so I don't think not having a perfect mathematical solution for credit assignment is a problem. 
The third component is that of time. I think this directly follows from the outcome-orientation of my definition. If you want to produce as much outcome as possible there is no reason to work like crazy now, burn out and repeat. Rather you should work as much as you can sustain over a long period of time. Of course, you can also balance this with other interests. I don't suggest your life should be entirely focused around work. 

## Framing

While thinking about productivity I found that sports are a fitting analogy and help to make some aspects clearer. Both sports and productivity is limited by physical constaints. There is a certain amount you can do per week and it is probably less than the amount of time you are awake. Both are trainable and require active effort for improvements. Getting rid of our bad habits, improving our work routines, changing our frame of mind and reducing our procrastination are all skills that don't come over night. Rather, similar to sports, you have to get better step by step but will likely see tangible improvements over time once you put in some effort. While this might sound rather uncomforting, I think it is important to accept this fact. 

Think of productivity as sport: trainable, physical constraints, etc. + there are differences: not too much peaking, etc.

a) There are physical limitations and constraints

b) Different levels of optimization: 40 - 80h workweek

## High-level View

Many decisions are not local but still increase productivity

a) Make sure you are on the right path: double check you are working towards the goal you want to achieve. Prioritize at all stages.

b) Don't optimize for the short-term, consistency, plot of "academia workload setting"

c) Physical conditions: sleep and fitness

d) Surroundings: optimize for productivity, e.g. right lighting (f.lux, daylight lamp), fresh air, right seating position and ergonomic chairs, split work and rest place, find yourself in groups that are productive

e) Improve your basic skills: analytics, math backgrounds, coding, etc. 

## Low-level View

The more day to day decision making process

a) Prioritize, deligate, communicate

b) Divide and conquer

c) Lists for everything

## Conclusions
