## **What is this post about?**

I have recently tried to increase my productivity. And while there are tons of guides out there that promise to increase your productivity most of them don't even define what they mean. Due to this absence of a clear concept many of these hints optimize a rather local and short-termist perspective of productivity that might be intuitive but is in my opinion not optimizing your true long-term goal once you think about productivity a bit longer. 

In this blogpost, I want to do three things: a) Justify a definition of productivity from which I derive high-level actions to improve it, b) provide a lot of framing, i.e. ways to think about productivity, and c) give a concise summary of the exististing literature about the tips and tricks that can improve our everyday workflow in a sustainable fashion. 

For this post I have read a lot of ressources on productivity and I think the vast majority is actually pretty bad. So before I get to the ones that I can actually recommend, I first want to point out which ones you should avoid and why. First on the anti-recommendation list are short lists such as "10 tips to increase your productivity" that provide tricks to increase your productivity. They are usually lacking crucial contextualization or focus on the wrong notion of productivity (see Definition) and thereby won't stick very long. Secondly, there are three books that I read which I would advise not to read. They are "Eat that Frog", "7 habits of highly effective people" and "Getting Things Done - the art of stress-free producivity". I found that all of them are 5% signal and 95% noise and most important messages could have been summarized on 5 to 10 pages. Ironically, a book that supposidly tells you how to save time inlates its content by out-of-context quotes, analogies that don't even support their point, personal stories that also don't support their argument, pseudo-scientific explanations as long as they broadly support their claim and incredibly lengthy descriptions of ideas that can be entirely described in a short sentence. Maybe they had to hit a page count. They are not entirely without useful content though and a summary of the 5% signal can be found further down this blog post. 

While the just described resources were surprisingly bad, there were two that I found very good and I can fully recommend them to everyone interested in productivity. The first one is "Atomic Habits TODO" by James Clear. I found the approach to productivity as presented in that book way more realistic, the explanations more reasonable and the long-term goal more plausible. Instead of pretending that you "just had to follow this magic rule to get immediate and tangible results", James Clear shows how marginal gains accumulate over time and how you can improve your habits bit by bit to get closer to a predefined goal. The second resource I can whole-heartedly recommend is <a href='https://mindingourway.com/guilt/?fbclid=IwAR25lO7_ltZGyS87T3ulLi3SKVYbwWiHDS_DiLxHxYprDkGzJ40hEkKpFCU'>"The Replacing Guilt Series"</a> which mostly focuses on the mental aspects of producvitity with a special emphasis on guilt. The author, Nate Soares, gives a detailed account of many human behaviours associated with productivity that are driven by guilt and argues why it is a bad and ultimately ineffective motivator. 

The following is a mix of my own considerations on productivity, restructured summary of the good resources and bits of the bad ones. 

## Definition

The image that I had in my head when I intuitively thought about productivity was very much based on a short-term satisfaction of emotions. It was one where I got up in the morning, immediatly started working, my hands flying over the keyboard solving task after task and ticking all boxes on my todo-list. After the an entire day of work I go to bed filled with contempt since I have completed so many tasks and looking forward to repeat the same process in the following days. While this is slightly exaggerated, people I have spoken to have a similar intuition. However, I think that this framing has three major problems: a) It is clearly not realistic. Your body has limits and most tasks are actually complicated. If you are just ticking boxes all day, you should look for harder problems to solve. b) It focuses on the wrong target. The just described intuition implicitely focuses on the emotional satisfaction from ticking boxes but does not measure the actual outcome of your work. You can tick boxes all day and feel good about it without actually getting anything done and, inversely, you can get a lot done by asking one simple question to the right person even though this might not feel emotionally appealing at all. c) It is too short-termist. While it definitely feels nice to ride on the emotional high for a while this definition doesn't ask simple yet important questions like "How long can you endure this kind of behaviour?" or "Is it actually the optimal way to reach a long-term target?".

In contrast I want to propose a different view of productivity which might be more boring but captures the desired aspects better. I define productivity as the sum of outcomes that can be attributed to your actions over time. Because this sounds very abstract, I want to elaborate on the three main components. 
Firstly, it focuses on outcomes not on the amount of time spend on something. While you will get a better outcome if you invest more time this isn't always the case. If I am able to solve one homework exercise in an hour but my friend solved three in the same timespan, I would say they were more productive than I was. I would even support this claim in extreme cases. Assume, for example, there is scientist A who works all their life to solve a particular problem but never achieves it. One day scientist B looks at the problem, thinks about it for 5 minutes and solves it. Then we intuitively think that scientist A has worked really hard and it would be unfair to claim that scientist B was more productive. But if we compared machine A which makes 1 widget per hour and machine B which makes 1000 widgets per hour, there would be no doubt that machine B is more productive. I also think that most people in real life already agree with the notion that productivity is not equal to the strength of the intention put into the process. If you had an employee that works 80 hours a week with best intentions but gets done only half as much as another person who only works 40 hours you would not promote the first one. 
The second component is the attribution to your actions. I think that this is the weakest link of my definition because it is very hard or impossible to assign credit for the causal contribution of everyone working towards a product. Maybe your contribution is only possible because someone else did research before you or maybe a product could only be made because two individuals worked together but would be impossible if either of them was missing. However, the goal of this post is to think about a concept and not to derive a universally optimal measurement for productivity so I don't think not having a perfect mathematical solution for credit assignment is a problem. 
The third component is that of time. I think this directly follows from the outcome-orientation of my definition. If you want to produce as much outcome as possible there is no reason to work like crazy now, burn out and repeat. Rather you should work as much as you can sustain over a long period of time. Of course, you can also balance this with other interests. I don't suggest your life should be entirely focused around work. 

TODO: econ definition of productivity

## Framing

While thinking about productivity I found that sports are a fitting analogy and help to make some aspects clearer. Both sports and productivity is limited by physical constaints. There is a certain amount you can do per week and it is probably less than the amount of time you are awake. Both are trainable and require active effort for improvements. Getting rid of our bad habits, improving our work routines, changing our frame of mind and reducing our procrastination are all skills that don't come over night. Rather, similar to sports, you have to get better step by step but will likely see tangible improvements over time once you put in some effort. Especially endurance sports require the correct pacing and so does productivity. If your goal was to run a marathon you wouldn't start sprinting from the start line and similarly if you wanted to reach a long-term goal and start by workin 80 hours a week you will very likely not keep up that effort. Lastly, different strategies for training show different effectiveness. In sports you can overtrain or you can train for the wrong task, e.g. only doing sprints while training for a marathon. 

Before we get into the details of implementation, I think it is very important to further frame what productivity is and especially how we should think about it to actually achieve more in less time while feeling good. 

#### 1. When to apply Productivity

TODO: productivity doesn't only include work. Could be exercise, books, healthier lifestyle, etc.  Different levels of optimization: 40 - 80h workweek

Intuitively, most people have at least two mostly seperated drawers in their head. One is for work things and one is for life things. When they think of productivity they apply this concept only to the work drawer, e.g. to create more output in the same amount of time or to work less with constant output. Once they are in life-mode they ignore the concepts of productivity they have applied to their work and essentially waste their freetime by achieving their non-work-related goals in very inefficient manners. The easiest way for me to think about the vague idea of productivity is that it is a tool to reach certain goals faster or in a more sustainable way and you can apply this tool to your personal life as well. If you want to learn a new language or instrument, lead a healthier lifestyle, exercise more, etc., why shouldn't you apply the same techniques that improve your work-productivity and make positive habits stick? You will have more freetime that you can then use to learn something new or start another personal project. 

The other common misconception I have often seen is that productivity is only achieved when you work 80 hours a week without ever getting distracted or needing a break. This is clearly unrealistic and having such an expectation will set you up for a unfruitful journey full of pain and disappointment. This is similar to setting yourself the goal to not only run a marathon but break the world record on the first attempt. A more healthy way to think about productivity is in terms of a tool that optimizes processes of your choice. If you want you can try to work 80 hours a week but you might first want to start with increasing your output during a classic 40 hour work week or keep similar output while working less time. You can then adapt once you're there but you wouldn't start your marathon preparation with 10 sessions per week. 

#### 2. You don't need to suffer to be productive

Another believe that seems to be pretty sticky is that productivity necessetates suffering. No pain, no gain. If you don't feel shitty for 8 hours every day, 40 hours every week and 160 hours every month, you just weren't "truely" productive. This is once again clearly false. If you measure productivity via output there is no reason to feel bad while getting there. I would even argue that you are doing something wrong if you feel bad the majority of your productive time. Either because you strive for a goal that you ultimately don't believe to be worth it, because your current strategy is very ineffective and you know it deep-down or because you are uncertain about what it actually is that you are working towards. 
I would say if productivity is done correctly, it should be a positive experience for the majority of the time. Obviously you still sometimes have to do annoying or boring tasks but when you work towards a worthy goal following a strategy that is as efficient as your current level of productivity allows for it should be a neutral or positive experience. I would also say that the result feels more satisfying when you are more productive; you free up time and have spent less time with annoying tasks along the way. 

#### 3. Don't be guilt-driven

Guilt is a bad motivator for many reasons! <a href='https://mindingourway.com/guilt/?fbclid=IwAR25lO7_ltZGyS87T3ulLi3SKVYbwWiHDS_DiLxHxYprDkGzJ40hEkKpFCU'>"The Replacing Guilt Series"</a> makes this argument in way more detail and I can recommend checking it out. Firstly, guilt is often external. You feel guilty because you are afraid to not meet social expectations and that you could disappoint your friends, parents or society at large by not meeting a goal that you don't even truely believe in. Secondly, even if the goals are your own, guilt comes from the absence of an action or result. You feel guilty because you didn't do something that you think you should have done. However, most of the time you will have multiple things to do and if you don't get all of them done you will always feel guilty. Even though it was impossible to complete all tasks to begin with you will still feel that nagging voice in the back of your head telling you to feel bad because you might have actually done everything if you suddenly evolved superpowers. Guilt doesn't care whether that's an unrealistic or even impossible expectation. It comes either way. Ultimately, and I think most importantly, guilt is just a remnant of out monkey brains. It is an emotion designed for immediate survival and reproduction. Evolution takes too long to adapt in the same time spans as human civilisation and therefore it is just highly unlikely that guilt is the correct motivation to reach abstract goals in an environment that our system 1 is not at all designed for. It would be way better to use system 2 to think about the process and design it in such a way that our motivation aligns with the overall goal. Implementations will be discussed further down. 

Additionally, working yourself rugged is not a virtue. I have for a long time kept the intuition that I would only be productive if I spend literally every minute on working towards my goal. Since this is unrealistic and not sustainable over a longer period of time I usually felt guilty. This is once more a weird expectation but I just never really thought about it very clearly. A marathon runner doesn't train 24/7 because there are physical limits to their body and we wouldn't say he should feel guilty about resting periods. Since there are also physical and mental limits to the amount of time we can be highly concentrated and productive we should neither feel guilty about taking breaks but even embrace them. Pretending there is no limit is a very effective way to burn yourself out and thereby achieving less of your desired goal in the long-term. 

#### 4. Atomic Changes

This mantra is the core of James Clears book TODO and I can recommend reading the whole thing if this sounds reasonable to you. In short, you can't realistically expect to change your productivity over night because your habits are usually very sticky. Think of it as a never ending journey where you change one bad habit at a time. While the gain over every short period of time seems small, marginal gains accumulate and yields large effects over longer time spans. If you were to pick up running, you wouldn't expect to see immediate gains after a week but rather that you would slowly improve over time if you keep training regularly using the correct strategy. For productivity it's similar. Instead of training your muscles you train your mind by slowly changing your current routines to their more desirable versions. 

#### 5. Identity not Outcome

Even though I have defined outcome via output over time and it makes sense to reason about productivity like that in the abstract it is not necessarily action guiding. James Clear suggests that one should not try to run a marathon but strive to become a runner. Instead of writing a book one should intend to become a writer. I find it most intuitive to described this by saying "Be Bayesian about your goal". If you have identified a goal, e.g. running a marathon, you should think about the underlying process that would generate an individual that fulfills that goal. Which habits and beliefs would that individual have and which actions would it take? Once this is clear, try to become that individual - take on that identity. This way of thinking has many advantages.
Firstly, it detaches your behaviour from the explicit goal. While this sounds counterintuitive at first, it makes a lot of sense. Usually, your specified goal, e.g. to run a marathon is part of a overarching goal, e.g. become fitter and more healthy. Your identity is usually connected closer to the overarching goal than the specified goal and therefore more appropriate. What if, for example, the marathon was cancelled? If you focus on output your project is over, if you focus on identity you are still a runner. 
Secondly, identity keeps you going. People are ultimately very tribal. Being part of an identity is rewarding because it unlocks all the bonus features from being part of that tribe. A true runner has a peer group which is connected through running they follow important people in the sport on Twitter and share running memes. If it's part of your identity it's harder to give up on the way and more likely you keep at it once your initial goal is done, e.g. to stick with running and keeping a healthy lifestyle even after the first marathon is finished. With the identity-based approach you obviously have to make very sure that the goal is actually something you truely desire because it also means that quitting for good reasons is harder. 
Lastly, the identity-based approach is more achievable. Slowly aligning your idenity is way more gradual and can be done in small steps whereas having one goal is binary and far into the future. This means you have a simple and easy path to follow which makes it more likely to stick to it and ultimately achieve the goal of being a fit and healthy person. 

The outcome-focused definition of productivity and the identity-approach of achieving it are not inconsistent. It is just a way to first think hard about the long-term goal that we want to achieve and then maximize the chance of achieving it by "tricking" our monkey brains into the right actions. Ultimately, we have to work with what's available. 

#### 6. Play the Long Game

If you agree with my definition of productivity as maximizing expected outcome, we will have to accept a less narrow and short-termist perspective of productivity than we might find intuitive. A deadline-oriented approach to productivity, where you work less than possible for a long period and much more than possible when the deadline is close, is not very productive under this definition. These high-intensity efforts with all-nighters are not only prone to making mistakes or being careless because of the time pressure, they also require long recovery periods after the deadline is over which usually means that you are in fact performing worse on your long-term goal of academic improvements. If you want to run a marathon you should optimally pace all 42 kilometers exactly the same and we would all agree that it is inefficient to sprint every 10k for a short period before setting a lower pace for recovery. Deadline mode is the same. Consistency is key for productivity even if it might not generate the same feeling as going all out from time to time. But I would rather be boring and get stuff done than feeling hyped without results and I'm pretty sure your supervisor would want that too. 

Playing the long game also has implications on the exploration vs. exploitation tradeoff. Intuitively, we want to do something and see results (maybe that's just me) even though it is probably not the most efficient way to achieve your long-term or even short-term goal. Most problems that we face or related ones have been solved by other people before and by exploring their strategies, following their advice and investigating their bottlenecks we are, on average, faster at the result. To me a day of reading papers always feels less productive than coding, writing, running experiments, etc. even though it is probably more productive objectively. This is not only true in the short-term settings of an individual project but also in the larger scheme of things. Education often felt a bit unproductive to me since you are not making a product or doing something that changes the world meaningfully you just sit and learn. However, education creates productivity capital that is worth much more in the long run. If an individual isn't educated they can work as hard as they want but probably wouldn't be able to solve really complex problems like creating a vaccine, building complex algorithms or improving society in other ways because they simply lack the fundamental understanding of their field. Simply understanding and acknowledging this fact is already important. It means that after a day of reading background papers or during university you can overwrite the guilt generated by your system 1 for "being unproductive" with the knowledge of your system 2 that you are in fact productive even though the results will only be seen later on. 

## Implementation

After the framing section I hope we have a clear way on how to think about productivity. However, this alone doesn't get us anywhere, we still have to implement changes in our lives to achieve our goals more effectively. This is what this section is concerned with. While many of the tips and tricks seem intuitive and obvious it is important to keep in mind that they are designed for our monkey brain. Just because we agree that they are good and obvious doesn't mean that we already apply them. Often we do just the opposite, we don't apply them but once we are asked we pretend we do because "we would be dumb not to use them". There is no shame in accepting that your brain likes short-term gratification and that you have very limited band-width. There is no reason to feel bad that you don't have the mental fortitude to resist distractions and procrastinations all the time. Rather you should observe that they exist and design systems around you such that they account for the architecture of your brain. 

I have ordered the following items according to my perceived importance and will try to justify that importance along the way. 

#### 1. Conditions 

If you are physically or mentally unhealthy, you are significantly less likely to fulfill your productivity potential and achieve your goals. If you consistently don't sleep enough you won't function well and thus be less productive (I have written another post on <a href='http://www.mariushobbhahn.com/2020-12-26-good_sleep/'>sleep</a>). If you are constantly too busy to go to the doctor for routine checks and then develop a condition that removes you from being productive for a month you are in sum less productive. The same is true for mental conditions. If you get burned out after being drowned with work for a longer period of time you will have to take a break that which usually means you could have been more productive and less stressed when working a consistent amount over the entire period. A healthy body and mind are not trade-offs to your productivity, they are necessary conditions for it. 

To which extent you want to optimize your personal health is up to personal preference but I mostly want to emphasize that you won't get away with neglecting it. I personally try to follow an 80:20 approach where you broadly try to eat healthy, exercise around 2 times a week and care about my sleep. This way I make sure that I prevent the majority of negative consequences but still have a lot of time doing other stuff. I am fully aware though, that I could improve these conditions with more time and effort but not willing to because the marginal gains do not justify the spent time. 

#### 2. Environments

d) Surroundings: optimize for productivity, e.g. right lighting (f.lux, daylight lamp), fresh air, right seating position and ergonomic chairs, split work and rest place, find yourself in groups that are productive

#### 3. Clearly Identify your Goal

1. Find your goal; key result areas (what are you hired for?); Mountain analogy; Don't overoptimize for your goal: focus on system once you defined your goal. commit to process

#### 4. Prioritize, a lot!!

2. prioritize hard, 80:20 rule, all levels, re-evaluate from time to time, most important first, drop low-value tasks that keep you busy but don't get results; ABCDE

3. Planing. Plan long-term, Planning fallacy; preparation; slice and dice; start now; action intention; start habit by small first steps; 

4. Outsource and delegate; say no to everything that is not vital to achieving your current goal; say no nicely but firmly; outsource through alarms, calenders, notetaking, etc.; don't spread over too many tools; 2-minute rule of action.

5. Procrastinate wisely; active not passive; 

6. Evaluation; yourself and feedbacok from others; weekly reviews, etc.; project-based reviews; 

7. Clear communication; communicate priorities to others

8. Upgrade key skills; never stop learning; 

9. Identify key constraints; identify what's stopping you from your goal; identify bad habits by writing down whatever you currently do; invert the good habit rules (see atomic habits)

10. Pressure; deadlines; positive mental attitude

11. Technology; Remove distraction; prioritize hard; good helper if used correctly.

12. Sessions; 90 min work, 15 min break

13. No multitasking

14. Always ask "what is the next action?"

15. Improve your basic skills: analytics, math backgrounds, coding, etc. 

16. connect things that you want to do with things that you should do. 

17. reframe your beliefs and baselines, e.g. wheelchair

18. Put in your reps

19. short-term gratification for long-term rewards

20. accountability partners & contracts

21. new homunculus; locate yourself; 3rd person view; 

22. Set realistic expectations

23. Account for your flaws: Pretend actions are not stoppable: https://mindingourway.com/where-coulds-go/

24. What if questions when you rationalize bad results

25. No excuses: https://mindingourway.com/have-no-excuses/; treat it as a bet: either you took the bet and would take it again or you took the bet at the wrong odds.

26. Come to your terms https://mindingourway.com/come-to-your-terms/ make all options explicit. Make the guilt explicit: e.g. the beggar in https://mindingourway.com/transmute-guilt-i/

27. Reflect what is obvious: https://mindingourway.com/obvious-advice/
