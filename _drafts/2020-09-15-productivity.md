## **What is this post about?**

productivity

**Definition:** What do I mean by productivity?

## Framing

Think of productivity as sport: trainable, physical constraints, etc.

a) There are physical limitations and constraints

b) Different levels of optimization: 40 - 80h workweek

## High-level View

Many decisions are not local but still increase productivity

a) Make sure you are on the right path: double check you are working towards the goal you want to achieve. 

b) Don't optimize for the short-term, consistency, plot of "academia workload setting"

c) Physical conditions: sleep and fitness

d) Surroundings: optimize for productivity, e.g. right lighting (f.lux, daylight lamp), fresh air, right seating position and ergonomic chairs, split work and rest place

e) Improve your basic skills: analytics, math backgrounds, coding, etc. 

## Low-level View

The more day to day decision making process

a) Prioritize, deligate, communicate

b) Divide and conquer

c) Lists for everything

## Conclusions
