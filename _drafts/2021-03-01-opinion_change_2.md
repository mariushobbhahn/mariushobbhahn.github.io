## **What is this post about?**

I have tried to make it a habit to keep track of beliefs I changed my mind about to understand underlying reasons or overarching trends. I have already posted a <a href='http://www.mariushobbhahn.com/2020-05-10-Opinion_change/'>similar article</a> some time ago and won't repeat its content here. If you are interested in a deeper motivation or the things I have previously changed my mind about just check out the other article. TODO:rephrase

This post is softer than the first one in the sense that I won't only mention things I had a very explicit opinion on but does also include important considerations I have learned and find worth sharing. TODO:rephrase

If you like the post and know other people who you expect to like it, please share it with them. If you didn't like it or disagree please tell me why.

#### Entropy-based decision-making

In one of his lectures my PhD supervisor, <a href='https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/methoden-des-maschinellen-lernens/personen/philipp-hennig/'>Philipp Hennig</a>, introduced the concept of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)'>entropy</a> in the context of experimental design. You should, for example, choose participants in an experiment such that you maximize information gain rather than choosing them at random. I found this very insightful and try to extend this to everyday high- and low-level decision making. In more simple terms, I try to ask questions such that the answers provide the most valuable information. In conversations I think this framework makes it easier to force yourself to understand what the disagreement is than to e.g. fall back on your prior beliefs or fall victim to your biases. I usually ask "What does the other person believe?", "Where do we disagree?" and "Do I find their position more plausible than my current one?" because these questions are the fastest way of gaining more understanding for me.

In general, this mindset is applicable in lots of places, e.g. when reading books or blogposts. Most books are not good enough that it's worth reading every page. Thus, if you want to maximize information gain, it makes sense to skim or skip parts that you expect to know already and very carefully read those that you don't. My blogposts are also designed such that people with this mindset can gain information as efficiently as possible, i.e. my captions are summaries of the section's content and people can decide themselves whether they want to read or skip it. 

I think it also changed the way I view news. Most everyday news give a feeling of urgency or importance. But in the grand scheme of things they are usually pretty irrelevant. Thus I have shifted away from consuming daily or weekly news to mostly consuming in-depth analysis on blogs, podcasts or traditional media and then sometimes read summaries of current news. 

Clearly, the metric I'm applying is not only information gain because it would imply learning a lot of irrelevant stuff. Thus what I'm actually maximizing is something like a relevance-weighted information gain, e.g. I might try to learn as much as possible w.r.t. a particular goal. Overall this entropy-based decision-making is something I found conceptually helpful but haven't developed a numerical model for it. 

#### High-level prioritization > low-level hussle

TODO improve. It's not clear yet.

If you think and prioritize on a high-level you are more likely to choose an efficient way to reach a goal or realize that certain work is not even necessary. Thus I have moved away from the narrative that "working hard will automatically yield success" because some projects just don't make sense or certain approaches are doomed to fail. Therefore I have tried to make it a habit to first ask what my high-level goal is, then what the best way to achieve it is and then to execute that plan.

A framework that I found helpful for this priotization is trying to focus 80% of your energy on the most important 20% of your projects and the other way around (see <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle'>Pareto Principle</a>). 

Another habit I found useful is doing back-of-the-envelope calculations for everything that you can reasonably assign a number to. If you, for example, don't know whether it is worth to buy a new TV, just estimate how much you expect to use it and to how much cost-per-hour this translates. If you are uncertain, just create a best- and worst-case scenario. With the hourly values I find it much easier to estimate whether the purchase is worth it or not. 

I have written an <a href='https://www.mariushobbhahn.com/2021-01-10-productivity/'>article on productivity</a> if you are interested in more than just this short summary. 

#### I like Money more now

For some time I thought that you didn't really need a lot of money and that following your passion is much more important than trying to get rich. While it is certainly true that you can lead a decent life without having a lot of money, I value having it much more by now. This is mostly because I have realized that money can save you much time and annoyance and thus increase your freedom. If your phone is old and annoying money can buy you a new one. If you want to master a skill quickly money can buy you a good teacher. If there is a task that takes up a lot of time, you can employ someone to do the task for you. 

I'm probably still spending less money than the average person in Germany, but I have become much more willing to spend money to make my life easier. My past self would have never been willing to pay for <a href='https://roamresearch.com/'>Roam Research</a> or <a href='https://www.whoop.com/'>Whoop</a>. I have even recently decided to buy a MacBook because I was fed up with Linux problems. So far, I'm pretty happy about all of the three purchising decisions. 

#### Nature vs. Nurture vs. Skill vs. Luck

There is this never ending debate about whether people's success can be attributed to their own decisions, their genes or their circumstances. I can't offer any theoretical solutions regarding this question but I have clarified my own thoughts and found some practical answers for me. 

First of all, I have updated towards a higher importance of genetics. Partly this comes from understanding how specific the genetic setup of professional cyclists is (and other sports as well) and partly from interacting with very smart people who solved problems on the fly seemingly without even trying while having little expertise in said area. Secondly, I have updated towards a much more stochastic world. A lot of great inventions were pretty random, many careers happen because of random conversations or other seemingly random details and life in general just seems much more random than I initially assumed. Thirdly, I now understand better what baffles me about the American Dream debate, i.e. whether it is possible to get into any position you want if you just apply yourself. On the one hand, there are a lot of decisions that we make all the time and thus it seems plausible that continuously making better than average decisions would eventually accumulate to very large differences in outcomes compared to making average decisions. So in this sense I think it is theoretically possible to move towards better outcomes to a large extent (constraint by genes and luck). On the other hand, the statistics show that social mobility is very limited and upward mobility is hard to achieve even when people try hard. This seems to implicate to me that either the circumstances disable certain people from making good decisions (e.g. not being able to afford education) or people have a hard time to differentiate between good and bad decisions in some structural way and outcomes are therefore mostly determined by where you started. 

From this follow three practical consequences for me:
1. I try to have **two modes**, one for personal and one for societal questions. In the personal mode I try to improve my own decision-making, treat success and failure as results of my actions, try to improve them and not to blame others. This does not imply that I take full credit for my success (I know that I'm privileged) it is much more about dealing with failure. In the societal mode, I try to assume that people are to a large extent not responsible for their outcomes and try to design systems to account for this fact. In an election, for example, I usually vote for parties that try to improve systems rather than focus on individual responsibility, even if I personally act more in accordance with their message. TODO:rephrase
2. Maximizing **Luck surface area**. As described before, I think that there is large stochasticity in life. Thus a practical consequence is to diversify your bets and maximize luck surface area rather than focusing all of your efforts on one particular scenario. For my career choice this could, for example, look like having a plan A, B and C and as a more general rule it implies that I try not to tie my own self-worth too much to one particular goal or achievement because the probability of failure is larger than I intuitively assume. 
3. **Find out what your predispositions are good for**. From a societal perspective it is optimal when people specialize in what they are best at but also from a personal perspective it is more rewarding. Since I currently think that predispositions (e.g. genes or social) have a large impact on your life outcomes, it makes sense to spend more time figuring out what you are good at and specializing in that. At this point, I'm not sure what that thing is for me. I seem to be decent at many things but not excel at any of them. 

#### Follow the argument (and act on it)

TODO rephrase

In a trade-off between logic vs. intuition or logic vs. societal conventions I have updated to choosing logic in the vast majority of cases. There were a lot of cases in the recent past where the logic turned out to be correct even when my intuition was not aligned originally. When the news of the Corona-virus outbreak in China went public in January 2020 I understood the mathematical models of pandemics and yet I didn't adapt my expectations or life accordingly. I probably should have bought some masks, shorted some stocks and invested in Amazon. But I didn't follow the argument to its logical conclusion. When I first heard of the topic of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_animal_suffering'>wild animal suffering</a> my intuition was that it might be true but kinda weird and then mostly ignored it. Now, a couple of years down the line, wild animal suffering is an established area of research and more and more people consider it to be important. I had a very similar experience with AI-safety. By now, my intuition has proven to be wrong or at least laggy so often, that my default mode has become to first figure out why my intuition and the logic of the argument are not aligned and if this process doesn't yield any strong defense of my intuition, I try to override my intuition and act upon the logic. 

#### Look for the boring stuff

TODO: rephrase

An observation that I made about many different fields is that the paths associated with high status are often not those that maximize good or money. Often complicated things lead to high status while much more mundaine or boring options are often those where small changes could create better outcomes quite easily. I realized this, for example, when talking to medicine students. Very often, the most talented people in medicine want to become neurosurgeons because it has high status. However, Neurosciencence is pretty hard, progress is rather slow and currently most neurological diseases cannot be treated effectively. So if your goal was to either make more money or help more people in an efficient manner, it might make sense to search in the spaces that give less status but are have high prevalence, e.g. Malaria, cardiovascular diseases or chronic pain. Another area where I found a similar phenomenon is within academia. There seems to be a bias against writing overviews, benchmark papers or tutorials because they are seen as boring and people would rather want to be associated with something new and shiny. However, the boring papers often get many more citations, help out newcomers or generate ideas for new research directions. 

In the future I will try to explore paths that other people find boring when there is no logical explanation for its low status. If, for example, I found a start-up right now, it would probably be in a conventionally boring area with large reach such as utilities. 

#### Sleep more

Previously I have tried to sleep less to have more time and now I try to sleep more to have more productive time. For a long version of my findings see my blog post on sleep (TODO link). The short version is that good sleep has a much larger effect on my mood and productivity than I thought and I have thus tried to improve it through various means including a better bed and very regular sleeping times. Additionally, I have bought a whoop strap which tracks certain measurements as a proxy of sleep quality. An interesting finding was how many disruptions there are during an average sleep that you don't notice afterwards. When I sleep from 11pm to 7 am, for example, I am awake for over 30 minutes split into 10-15 different short intervals. So if my goal is to get eight hours of sleep I should aim for 8:30 instead. 

#### Research is even harder than expected

When I started my PhD I expected research to be hard but it turned out to be even harder. An analogy might capture this discrepancy best. The Bachelor's program is like a highway - everything is already established, there are lots of resources online and one can generally move fast. The Master's is more like a country road - content gets harder but you can still find stuff online but the speed is still decent. I expected the PhD to be like riding a bike on a cobbled road but now it feels more like slashing through the jungle with a machete. I'm not sure whether this is due to the nature of my project, the situation with corona, that I'm just not suited for a PhD or just a general feature of research but I found that other people tend to share my perspective. 

On the other hand, I feel like research could be much more efficient. Many PhDs (including me) work too much on their own, when working in groups might be much more effective. Furthermore aspects of academia are set up in inefficient ways. This might be especially true for Machine Learning but reviewers are often not experts in the subfield they are reviewing and thus the noise for reviews is much higher. Therefore researchers often have to do things that don't make any sense to please their reviewers or have to reroll the dice until they get expert reviewers. This is not a complaint about being rejections. My paper has been rejected by experts for good reasons and their feedback genuinly improved it. 

#### Discourse on Racism and Sexism

The discourse on Racism and Sexism but also on other hot topics has taken a shape that I find very inefficient and emotionally draining. I share the vast majority of goals with the people who lead the discourse and yet our approaches are so different. I, on the one hand, care a lot about boring practical stuff, like which ways of reducing (gender or racial) inequality are effective, which of them are politically feasible, etc. The discourse on these issues, on the other hand, is often more concerned with the identity of the messenger, the exact semantics of racism or wild accusations. I expect this to be mostly a result of signalling on social media and an urge of people to "do something" in showing their infinite support of marginalized groups but I find it hard to find a common ground. I often find it so hard to distinguish signal from noise that I just ignore a point when people start accusing someone of racism or sexism in a strong manner. I think this is a bad trend because there are many people or arguments who argue for a worthy cause. I would be genuinly interested in which kind of strategies people persue to solve this dilemma if they are in a similar situation as I just described. 

#### I'm more introvert than I thought

I was quite aware that I'm more on introvert end of the spectrum, i.e. more social conversations feel like they cost me energy, rather gaining it. During the pandemic I held social interaction to a minimum. Minimizing real life interaction was obviously intentional but I also unintentionally reduced online interactions. That wasn't due to ill will but rather that I just kinda forgot about it. I was still living with my girlfriend so I was rarely truely alone but even when she went to visit her family, I didn't really feel lonely. I can't tell whether this would have changed when the time spent alone would have been longer but it seems like as long as I have the internet I'm fine. 

#### Moving in with my Girlfriend was better than expected

I expected that moving in with my GF would be just fine - that there would be advantages, e.g. of being able to spend more time together, but also disadvantages, e.g. that we would annoy each other or start fighting over small stuff. It turned out that I overestimated the downsides and underestimated the upsides. For example, I have undervalued how helpful it can be to split up cooking duties depending on how busy we are. Furthermore we didn't really start to get annoyed from each other. 

#### Apple

I used to think that Apple products were overpriced because people were willing to pay extra for a status symbol. Recently, I needed a new phone and laptop and no matter which comparison I looked at the Apple products were very good value for money. I have decided against an Iphone but in favor of a MacBook with the M1 chip and I don't think I will go back. The Apple products seem to create much less problems than the Linux alternatives and I can spend more time working towards my actual goal. Thus I think the core products, i.e. Iphone and MacBook, are correctly priced. However, the additional gadgets such as adapters, more RAM or chargers are massively overpriced and I feel like being extorted whenever I buy one. 

## Society

#### I became a Joe Biden fanboy

During the primaries I was already more of a Joe Biden fan than most of my progressive friends. Our disagreement mostly came from how likely we estimated a more progressive candidate than Biden to win the overall election and how conservative Joe Biden would be in comparison to e.g. Sanders or Warren. But now after the election is over and we have a better Idea of Biden's politics, I have become a big Biden fanboy. First of all, Biden didn't get baited during the primaries to commit to incredibly unpopular policies to please very progressive members, e.g. decriminalizing border crossings or reparations. I'm not saying these are necessarily bad policies, just that they are terrible unpopular and could have costed the candidate the overall win. Secondly, his cabinat seems to be very well-chosen. In most positions it combines the expertise of a person with an overall progressive agenda, e.g. more women than previous cabinetes. Thirdly, he shows an actual effort to win over republican law-makers and work with them but also uses his majority in the senate to pass important legislation if republicans decide not to cooperate. Fourthly, I just like most of his policies. His administration is willing to tackle important problems even if they are boring and don't earn him lot's of airtime or attention. I guess it just feels good to have someone in power who is willing to fix infrastructure and sort out the pandemic whithout being distracted by the daily clown show of American politics.

#### Neoliberalism & YIMBYism

I have written a <a href='https://www.mariushobbhahn.com/2021-03-19-neoliberal/'>blog post</a> on my economic positions. In short, a) I have become more market friendly but think that the rewards should be distributed, e.g. fast technological growth is desirable but the rewards have to be redistributed. b) I'm a radical pragmatic, i.e. I believe in what works, independent of its ideological connotation. c) I would prioritize economic growth over social equality most of the time. My mind opinion was informed by the Our World in Data charts on <a href='https://ourworldindata.org/economic-growth#'>economic growth</a> and <a href='https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty'>extreme poverty</a>. But the base case is just: Economic growth is the best way to reduce poverty and poverty is worse than inequality, at least in longer time frames. 

Neoliberalism is also involved in the housing debate and argues to build more housing and deregulate zoning laws. The more I learned about housing policy the more I got convinced of the importace of available housing. When rents are lower people have more money which increases their agency and leads to more economic growth. Furthermore it has effects on social justice because poorer people, especially from minority backgrounds, are more likely to rent rather than own a home. Thus a strongly regulated housing market is effectively a redistribution from poor to rich. My conviction of YIMBYism (Yes In My BackYard) has become so strong that I cannot unthink it anymore. Whenever I see an empty spot in a city my first thought is "Somebody should build a house right here". I have accidentally become a city designer without the intention, expertise or capital to build housing. 

#### Video Games

Video games are an incredible money-efficient way to generate happiness. They usually don't cost more than 100€ but you can spend hundreds or thousands of hours playing them. Furthermore, they increase your agency, as you can choose which character you want to be, e.g. which gender or ethnicity they have, and because you can explore impressive virtual worlds. They also remove a lot of they annoying parts of real life. You just respawn if you die, goals are clearly defined and the mechanics of a game are much simpler than those of the real world. So if you want to maximize your own happiness, I think video games are one of the best ways to do so. 

However, since I'm an effective altruist and thus want to help others rather than maximizing my own happines, I try to reduce my video game consumption as much as possible. I found that I'm very responsive to the advantages of video games and tend to get somewhat addicted rather quickly. Since this doesn't allow for a limited consumption I needed to stop playing those games entirely. 

#### Nuclear Energy



#### Private insurance

I used to think that private insurance was bad because it is unfair. The most prominent example of unfair treatment is the large discrepance in waiting time between publicly vs. privately insured patients. By now I am willing to trade off this unfairness for the benefits the private system provides. My understanding is that people pay disproportionately more money than they receive privileges. This means that richer people cross subsidise poorer patients by being covered for more exotic conditions or having a larger bed during a hospital stay. My mind was changed mostly by talking to doctors who said that without their privately insured patients their prices would rise drastically. 

#### Recycling and Trash

Even though this is a pretty niche topic, my opinions have actually changed quite drastically on it. Firstly, I was convinced that we should recycle our trash because it is more sustainable. Then Rob Wiblin changed my mind with <a href='https://medium.com/@robertwiblin/what-you-think-about-landfill-and-recycling-is-probably-totally-wrong-3a6cf57049ce'>this article</a> where he argues that recycling is often very inefficient and landfills can be well run for relatively low costs. Then my mind was changed again by a long discussion with my father who has been working in the energy business and built waste incineration power stations for most of his career. He argued that the problem with landfills wasn't toxic water (this can be managed) but rather sponanious fires that are impossible to control. Since landfills contain a lot of easily inflammable materials and have high pressure in the bottom they can ignite easily. Once a fire has developed it is nearly impossible to get under control due to the large amount of trash. The smoke of such a fire is usually very toxic and can have strong health consequences for surrounding towns. Thus the best option seems to be to recycle whenever it is feasible and burn the remaining trash in a waste incineration power station where toxic gases are filtered and the resulting energy is put in the grid.
