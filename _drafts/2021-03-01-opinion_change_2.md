## **What is this post about?**

I have tried to make it a habit to keep track of things I changed my mind about to understand underlying reasons or overarching trends. I have already published a <a href='http://www.mariushobbhahn.com/2020-05-10-Opinion_change/'>similar article</a> some time ago and won't repeat content here. If you are interested in a deeper motivation or the things I have previously changed my mind about just check out the previous article. 

This post is softer than the first one in the sense that I won't only mention things I had a very explicit opinion on but does also include important considerations I have learned and find worth sharing. 

If you like the post and know other people who you expect to like it, please share it with them. If you didn't like it or disagree please contact me and tell me why.

## Personal

#### Entropy-based decision-making

In one of his lectures my PhD supervisor, <a href='https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/methoden-des-maschinellen-lernens/personen/philipp-hennig/'>Philipp Hennig</a>, introduced the concept of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)'>entropy</a> in the context of experimental design. For example, you should choose participants in an experiment such that you maximize information gain instead of choosing them randomly. I found this very insightfull and try to extend this to everyday high- and low-level decision making. In more simple terms, I try to ask questions such that all possible answers provide the most valuable information. In conversations I think this framework makes it easier to force yourself to understand what the disagreement is than to e.g. fall back on your prior beliefs or fall victim to your biases. In general, this mindset is applicable in lots of places, e.g. when reading books or blogposts. Most books are not so good that it is worth reading every page. Thus, if you want to maximize information gain, it makes sense to skim or skip parts that you expect to know already and read carefully those that you don't. My blogposts are also designed such that people with this mindset can gain information as efficiently as possible, i.e. my captions are summaries of the sections content and people can decide themselves whether they want to read or skip it. 

#### High-level prioritization > low-level hussle

If you think and prioritize on a high-level you are more likely to choose an efficient way to reach a goal or realize that certain work is not even necessary. Thus I have moved away from the narrative that "working hard will automatically yield success" because some projects just don't make sense or certain approaches are doomed to fail. Therefore I have tried to make it a habit to first ask what my high-level goal is, then what the best way to achieve it is and then to execute it. 

A tool that I found helpful for this priotization is trying to focus 80% of your energy on the most important 20% of your projects and the other way around (see <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle'>Pareto Principle</a>). Another habit I found useful is doing back-of-the-envelope calculations for everything that you can reasonably assign a number to. If you, for example, don't know whether it is worth to buy a new TV, just estimate how much you expect to use it and to how much cost-per-hour this translates. If you are uncertain, just create a best- and worst-case scenario. With the hourly values I find it much easier to estimate whether the purchase is worth it or not. 

I have written an <a href='https://www.mariushobbhahn.com/2021-01-10-productivity/'>article on productivity</a> if you are interested in more than just this short summary. 

#### I like Money more now

TODO:shorter

For some time I thought that you didn't really need a lot of money and that doing the things you like is much more important than e.g. trying to get rich. While it is certainly true that you can lead a decent life without having a lot of money I value having it much more by now. This is mostly because I have realized that money can save you much time and annoyance and thus increase your freedom. If your phone is old and annoying money can buy you a new one. If you want to master a skill quickly money can buy you a good teacher. If there is a task that takes up a lot of time, you can employ someone to do the task for you. 

I'm probably still spending less money than the average person in Germany, but I have become much more willing to spend money to make my life easier. My past self would have never been willing to pay for <a href='https://roamresearch.com/'>Roam Research</a> or <a href='https://www.whoop.com/'>Whoop</a>. I have even recently decided to buy a MacBook because I was fed up with Linux problems. At least so far, I'm pretty happy about all of the three purchising decisions.
