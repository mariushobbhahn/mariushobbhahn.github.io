## **What is this post about?**

I have tried to make it a habit to keep track of things I changed my mind about to understand underlying reasons or overarching trends. I have already published a <a href='http://www.mariushobbhahn.com/2020-05-10-Opinion_change/'>similar article</a> some time ago and won't repeat content here. If you are interested in a deeper motivation or the things I have previously changed my mind about just check out the previous article. 

The format of the post is softer in the sense that I won't only mention things I had a very explicit opinion on but does also include important considerations I have learned and find worth sharing. 

If you like the post and know other people who you expect to like it, please share it with them. If you didn't like it or disagree please contact me and tell me why.
