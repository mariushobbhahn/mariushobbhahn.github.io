## **What is this post about?**

Luke's post and Howies 80000 podcast interview + realized that I got more happy now. 

TODO: happier lives institute

Big framing: Control zone vs. Out of control zone. 

Disclaimer, not an expert on happiness or depression

## Framing

Reward hack ourselves in a sustainable manner

To a large extent dependent of our own framing of a situation. In a vacuum can be happy despite shitty circumstances or depressed despite the best circumstances.
More realistic example: rejection in any setting, e.g. paper or job. To strong degree just defense mechanism. 

Don't complain, look for solutions. 

## Control Zone


### The Basics

Exercise, sleep, food, oxygen, sun, social contact; seem easy but help massively.

Trade-off with productivity and other things like health, talk about vitamin D

### Mental Frames



## Out-of-Control Zone

flood analogy; can't prevent the flood but mitigate the damage

### Depression and the Brain

### Depression and Genes



### Fail Safe See Mechanisms

 Howie; that's really smart, society should have this.
 
 Friend or family

The less effort the better

### Depression and Medication
