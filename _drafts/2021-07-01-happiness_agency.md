## **What is this post about?**

This post is the result of a long inquire into happiness and depression and was kicked off by two other resources. The first is Luke Muehlhauser's post <a href='https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZbgCx2ntD5eu8Cno9/how-to-be-happy'>How to Be Happy</a> from 2011 which convinced me that there are some aspects of happiness that you can quite drastically improve. The second is the <a href='https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/depression-anxiety-imposter-syndrome/'>80k podcast episode with Howie</a> which convinced me that there are many aspects of your mental health that you have absolutely no control over. To integrate these two points into one overarching model, I tried to understand happiness and depression better trying to answer two simple questions.
1. **How much control do you have about your happiness and depression?**
2. **What can you do to improve them or prevent worst case scenarios?**

**DISCLAIMER:** I'm not a trained professional in medicine, psychiatry or anything alike. After listening to personal accounts of depression, I'm pretty convinced that I have never been depressed and that my worst periods were mostly prolonged sadness mixed with unhealthy expectation management. Thus, this post should be seen as the result of 100-200 hours of reading, listening to personal stories and asking people who have more expertise rather than an expert review. With certainty, I got some things wrong and missed important context, etc. If you notice such an omission, please contact me. 

#### Summary of my results

Ultimately, I find it easiest to categorize the amount of control you have into three levels. As an analogy consider yourself in a boat on a river. The control over the boat is analogous to the control over your happiness. 

The first level is what I call the **Much Control Zone**. It includes things you can immediatly do or start to change that have a good chance of increasing your happiness such as doing more exercise, sleeping better or increasing exposure to the sun. In the boat analogy, this is calm water. You have a lot of control and with a bit of effort your steering can improve quite a bit. 

The second level is the **Some Control Zone**. These are things that include significant randomness but change is ultimately possible, even if it might require a lot of time and effort. These include the amount of money you earn, your job satisfaction or where you life. This is rougher waters where good steering improves your situation but random factors such as the boat you are given (lottery of birth) has a strong influence over your happiness and control its control. 

The third level is the **(mostly) Out of Control Zone**. It describes circumstances that are out of your control such as gender, genetics. The only way in which you can control the results of them is through prevention and mitigation strategies or giving more control to other people such as therapists. In the boat analogy, this is rapid wild waters where even the best boat handlers get wet and most people are hopelessly lost.

## Framing

Before we get into discussing the three zones, I want to clarify a couple of things about happiness and depression. 

### Depression is NOT just long sadness

My original model of depression was very naive in retrospect. Basically, I assumed that happiness and depression are two ends of the same spectrum and, therefore, depression just describes prolonged episodes of unhappiness. The more I talked to people and read research, the more I became convinced that this is untrue. Now, I think that the happiness spectrum and depression just describe different phenomena that are mostly unrelated but sometimes correlate. 
In this article I will use the term "happiness spectrum"  to describe a baseline satisfaction plus temporal mood swings. Depression on the other hand is a disorder/disease and used as an umbrella term for the medical conditions of e.g. major depression, persistant depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or seasonal affective disorder (see <a href='https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/depression-types'>here</a> for details). Depression can still affect your mood in the same way a fever usually makes you less happy but we would still see the fever as a seperate thing from happiness. 
Therefore, it is possible that people experience prolonged periods of sadness without being depressed or can be happy while being depressed, e.g. have a good mood but generally still feel aweful or very anxious about life. I found a personal account very helpful to understand depression as an outsider. They described it as if there was "a dense grey veil above everything". The food didn't taste like anything anymore, their perception of colors was much less intense and music was less enjoyable. 

As a consequence, this entire post is more like two posts in one. After some considerations, I decided against splitting them into two because many interventions and fundamental principles still overlap substantiable between the happiness spectrum and depression. 

A more detailed model of whether depression is one the same spectrum as happiness or whether it is categorically different can be found in Scott Alexanders blog post <a href='https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/ontology-of-psychiatric-conditions'>Ontology Of Psychiatric Conditions: Taxometrics</a>.

### A high-level model of happiness

On a high level, there are two drivers to both happiness and depression. The first is a mental component, e.g. through which frame of mind you look at the world, whether you are positive or negative thinking person, etc. Bhuddist monks, for example, reportedly improve their happiness mostly through years of slowly changing their perspective while their material circumstances stay the same. Therefore, I would argue that a mental frame has a significant impact on your happiness and a measurable but smaller effect on the probability and severity of depression. 

This, however, is clearly not the full story. The balance on your bank account, your social relationships, the quality of sleep, etc. usually have a measurable effect on your well-being and you can't just "think it away" even if you try very hard. Many of these drivers of happiness and depression have physical correlates in your body, e.g. an imbalance of certain hormones or neurotransmitters.

## Much Control Zone



### The Basics

Exercise, sleep, food, oxygen, sun, social contact; seem easy but help massively.

Trade-off with productivity and other things like health, talk about vitamin D

### Mental Frames

To a large extent dependent of our own framing of a situation. In a vacuum can be happy despite shitty circumstances or depressed despite the best circumstances.
More realistic example: rejection in any setting, e.g. paper or job. To strong degree just defense mechanism. 

Don't complain, look for solutions.
