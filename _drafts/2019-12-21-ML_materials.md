## **What is the purpose of this list?** 

During my time as a student I often missed a list of recourses when researching new subtopics of ML. Professors often suggest some books to accompany the lecture but they are not always the perfect fit. Either too specific or written in a incomprehensive manner. Often I found that a different book, a blog post, a video or an online tutorial that I found later or was suggested to me by friends turned out to improve my understanding of the topic in a way faster, more rewarding way. Additionally, I experienced that there is some latent knowledge in a field that is not found in any textbook. These are often tricks to improve the efficiency of an algorithm that 'everyone knows' and therefore does not tell you. That most often does not happen due to bad intentions but rather because people in the field think this is so obvious that they forget about the possibility you could not know. For example when I first heard about Neural Networks I grilled my CPU for hours until I found a blogpost using CUDA. I also never bothered about using vectorized notation (i.e. numpy/pytorch) to increase the speed of computation because I simply did not know that it matters. There are many such moments that I now look back upon and think: "how could I have been this dumb" but when talking to other students they had similar experiences. 

I also need to point out that this list of recourses can obviously not incorporate every subfield of ML and will also not contain all latent knowledge of the field (actually the vast majority is not contained). What I aim to give is a broad overview over some basic and sometimes more advanced resources for a field in ML. Since it is not always possible to draw clear lines between all topics you might have chosen a different structure than I did and if you have good reasons for it I would be happy if you contacted me and told me. Also I cannot be an expert in all fields of ML at the same time and therefore hope that this post becomes a bit of an collaborative effort that gets bigger and better over time. I try not to link papers because the post would blow up immediately. 

### Other Recourses

I am not the first one to link useful recourses. 

### Foundations of ML


### Probabilistic Inference 


### Reinforcement Learning


### Computer Vision


### Fairness in ML


### AI safety



#### ***One last note***

If you have any feedback regarding anything (i.e. layout, code or opinions) I would be happy if you told me. But please do it in a constructive manner.
