## **What is this post about?**

Whenever I ask people why they smoke I get an answer along the lines of "It sometimes helps with stress. I know I shouldn't do it. I'm trying to stop." But sometimes they then add something along the lines of "But it is actually good for the health care system as a whole because I will die younger and therefore cost the system less" or "The taxes generated through cigarettes are so high that they can easily pay for my lung cancer". I find both answers intuitively absurd but neither they nor I had looked at the data so no minds were changed through the conversation. 

Therefore, I want to answer two simple questions in the beginning of this article. Firstly, how much tax revenue is generated from cigarettes? And secondly, how much do diseases associated with smoking cost the healthcare system? In the last part of the post, I want to look at other considerations such as possible confounders, some conditional considerations and the moral implications of smoking. 

Before we answer those questions though, I want to give some basic overview statistics to get a better intuition for the demographics of smokers and the magnitude of the global tobacco industry. 

As always, if you disagree with my approach, with my analysis or with my conclusions, don't hesitate to contact me. 

## Some basic overview Statistics

How many people smoke conditional on region?

How many people smoke conditional on class?

How much money is in the tobacco industry? 

## 1. How much Tax Revenue do Cigarettes generate?

## 2. How harmful are Cigarettes?

## 3. Other considerations

### Dying younger

Some people argue that if they smoke they die younger and therefore are less of a burden on the healthcare system as your cost increase with age. While this observation is generally true the reasoning is still flawed. Statistically, you generate the highest cost of your 
TODO: check the data.

### Effects on others - passive smoking

### The moral implications 

## Conclusions
