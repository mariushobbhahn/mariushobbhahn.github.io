## **What is this post about?**

Personal Finance as an EA

balance EA principles and responsible financial habits

Also used to make my own princibles transparent and improve them if others have good ideas. 

TLDR: Spend money to save time, save up other money, donate some

## Framing

I assume people are EA

Time is more important than money from EA perspective

## Short-term spending

Spend money to save time

Spend money to remove annoyances / improve your well-being

Donate a certain amount because a) taxes, b) value drift

track your spending

## Long-term saving

save or donate?
a) see framing
b) uncertainty matters: bad times, start-ups, NGOs, etc.

save in ETFs: Use one that excludes the really bad stuff

## Conclusions
