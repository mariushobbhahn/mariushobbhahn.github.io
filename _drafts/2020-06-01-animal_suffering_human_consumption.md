This does not include Wild animal suffering

Because there are so many assumptions we need to make the estimate might be wrong by multiple orders of magnitude. 

## Why should animal suffering have moral weight?

Before we actually start comparing I think it is important to revisit the reasons why we should give animal suffering some moral weight. This is both for people who are rather new to these ideas but also for those who currently do not believe in them. If you have any objections regarding the followig arguments please let me know. 


## Shut up and calculate

Let's have a look at some numbers to have a chance of estimating upper and lower bounds for animal suffering

### Animals killed for production

with chicken

without chicken

fish

### How do we approximate animal suffering?

find upper and lower bounds for their living conditions

### How do we weigh animal suffering?

take numbers from consciousness and moral patienthood

find large upper and lower bounds

### How does it compare to humans?


### Nerd section - Data preparation


## Conclusions



## What could be improved in my modeling

1. More expert people have a better understanding of the comparisons (please contact me if you are e.g. working with an animal organisation and have ideas for quantification)

2.
