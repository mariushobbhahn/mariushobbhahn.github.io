## Why should animal suffering have moral weight?



## Shut up and calculate

### Animals killed for production

with chicken

without chicken


fish

### How do we approximate animal suffering?

find upper and lower bounds for their living conditions

### How do we weigh animal suffering?

take numbers from consciousness and moral patienthood

find large upper and lower bounds


### How does it compare to humans


### Nerd section - Data preparation


## Conclusions



## What could be improved in my modeling

1. More expert people have a better understanding of the comparisons (please contact me if you are e.g. working with an animal organisation and have ideas for quantification)

2.
