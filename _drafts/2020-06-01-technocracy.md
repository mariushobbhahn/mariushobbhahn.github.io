## **What is this post about?**



Disclaimer: I don't hate Democracy. 

## How would a technocracy look like?

1. **General framing:** 

2. **How does the selection work:**

## Flaws of democracy


1. **Leaders are selected for the wrong skills:**

2. **The voters:** a negative framing: people are actually dumb. a positive framing: people have more important stuff to do.

3. **Politicians have short-term incentives:**

4. **Superficial measurement of results:** most politicians don't check the results of their policies

5. **Elections are not very fine-grained:**

6. **Some election systems have serious flaws:** 50%, gerrymandering, etc.


## Addressing some concerns

### Other solutions within the democratic framework



### Politicians have advisors



### You need accountability


#### ***One last note***

If you have any feedback regarding anything (i.e. layout or opinions) please tell me in a constructive manner via your preferred means of communication.



Hello Wrap gang,

I hope you survived your exams and have less pressure now. A bunch of Effective Altruists are writing an article about seven different ML, AI and Neuroscience related Master's programs in Europe. There is lots of information about most programs online but we thought they miss a relevant piece: an inside view from someone who has first hand experience of the lectures, the city and the teaching staff. The report for other programs are between 4 and 5 pages and we have already written a template so you don't have to invest immense amounts of time. If you think this is a good idea and want to help others make this important decision easier I would be very grateful. 

Best, Marius
