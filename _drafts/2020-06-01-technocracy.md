## **What is this post about?**

I have always had a certain fascination with technocracy. Starting with simply questions as a child such as "Why would I be allowed to choose a person that is supposed to improve society when I have no idea what good ideas to improve society are or at best superficial understanding compared to someone studying the field for their entire life?". The more I learned about our biases, tendencies to vote against our own interests, flawed understanding of complex systems but overconfidence of our own intelligence, etc - the less I was convinced that we are actually well-suited to decide who should govern us. As always, if you think I'm wrong, ignore evidence or strawman an argument just reach out to me. If you know any interesting studies related to any of the following arguments please share them with me.

Disclaimer: I don't hate Democracy. It probably is one of the most robust systems of government we have developed but it has some flaws that I want to explore in the following. 

## How would a technocracy look like?

Designing a system of government is obviously a very hard task and I will not be able to a complete or flawless picture. I will therefore attempt to give a broad sketch about what I have in mind when I talk about "Technocracy". 

1. **General idea:** By technocracy I mean "rule of experts". A person that is in charge of a certain ministry, for example, should have a lot of experience in the field of, or a field very close to, that ministries competence. The secretary of health would likely have a background in medicine, public health studies or similar. The finance minister would probably have a background in public finance or economics. I expect that most people within the system would choose either a theory-oriented or a more practical route to end up in their position. The theory path would be through being a scientist within a specific field, conducting studies, looking at trends within data, building prediction models, etc. More practically minded people would rise up the ranks by starting in small regional government positions (e.g. assistant to the mayor of a small town) and work their way up the hirarchy if they are qualified. These people might also have worked in an NGO, say GiveWell, and then join the foreign ministry in some position. I would also expect that there would be a lot more training for these positions once they happen on a basis of qualification. I don't see why you should not be able to study "city-management" at a university or do a formal training in "government decision-making".

2. **How does the selection work?** Since people are not voted in or out of office other mechanisms have to be implemented. While I don't have a perfect solution there are lots of suggestions and other systems that one can adopt. I think it's important to realize that most government positions are not decided through elections in the first place. The vast majority of staff within a ministry is decided through a mixture of quality of applications, recommendations or networking. There might also be "mini-elections" where people who are already in the particular unit vote on a future candidate or certain formal interviews have to be passed, etc. I am completely fine with people voting on their group leader as long as the people who are voting have expertise in their respective field and are not lay people like you and me. You might also think that ministers don't have to be experts within their particular fields and that they are essentially just managers coordinating a group of experts and making high-level decisions or that experts might be too specialized, narrow-thinking or lack necessary management skills. However, I expect that positions would be selected for particular skills, e.g. someone who would fulfill the minister role would be selected for organizational skills additional to their expertise (maybe they lead multiple large-scale projects) and someone who is focused mostly on research would fulfill more of an advisery role. I think it's very important that the minister, even when they mostly coordinate, have expertise in their respective field. Being able to quickly assess whether a proposal would harm the practitioners on the ground, has been successful in other countries, etc. is important. Communication with the other experts within your field will also be more efficient and productive, as you don't have to be introduced to the basic concepts, know most jargon and understand what "just seems obvious" to your colleagues and what needs explaining. 
Just as is already the case in many parts of government, political or industrial organisations people would be selected for their skill and there are some ways to ensure that the selections are reasonable. 

3. **How are people held accountable?**

A strong justification for democracy is accountability - you vote politicians in and out of office because of the promises and mistakes they make. But there are lots of other ways to hold people accountable that are less noisy and happen more often than every four years. There are systems that already exist in the status quo like the media and judicial system that would highlight and procecute unlawful behaviour and missconduct. There are demonstrations when people feel left behind and disenfranchised and this feedback has not reached the goverment. There could be particular corruption units to check your financial ties with a certain industry if your policies are suspicously deregulatory. But there are also ways of accountability that would be stronger in technocracies. I expect technocrats to be more sensitive to feedback from their own community because they are used to a rigorous feedback process from their scientific work. There could be votes of no confidence when the people in the respective department think their leader does a bad job or there could be a committee whose sole purpose is to control the work of the ministeries by encouraging them to make falsifiable claims, publish their strategies to the public and providing feedback for improvement. But I hope that a lot of accountability would come through intrinsic motivation. Being a Professor implies lots of scientific freedom in most countries and you are very hard to get rid off. However, I know of very little cases where this status was misused because most Professors have a strong intrinsic motivation and emotional involvement with their respective field. (Side note: intrinsic motivation probably also applies to most politicians and is not my primary problem with the status quo)

Clearly, I can't cover all - even most - details of an actual implementation of such a system. I think a good way to test whether a specific problem you identified with my characterization is valid criticism is to ask whether it could be easily fixed within the system (e.g. a law could be added) or whether it requires changing something inherent to technocracy (e.g. introducing elections). 

## Flaws of democracy

In the following is a list of things of problems that I have with current implementations of democracies I have sorted in decreasing order of my personal perceived relevance.

### Leaders are selected for the wrong skills: 
This includes both the selection by the public through elections as well as mechanisms of self-selection throughout the career of a politician. 
1. **The skills required to become a leader are often not the same you need to be a good politician:** Becoming a politician requires you to be good at public speaking, handling large crowds, confirming to the social norms of your current surroundings, signalling intellectualism, signalling every possible positive stereotype you can think of, etc. There are lots of things that increase your chances of being elected because of social biases or the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_effect'>halo effect</a> even though they don't qualify you more. Being a man, being white, being above average attractive, having a deeper voice, project confidence, etc. all fall in this category. 
Being a good leader, on the other hand, requires a very different set of skills. Suddenly you can't only make empty promises and your actions have consequences. You have to coordinate very different interests from different public and private actors. You have to understand complex issues where nothing seems to really work the more you know about it. You have to make tough decisions that can effect millions of people and can drain on your mental health. You have to consider the effects on marginalized communities or future citizens and pick sides on complex moral questions. You have to make compromises because there are other politicians with other opinions. Overall, it's a tough and nasty job where you will mostly earn criticism by people who don't understand why you don't "just fix everything like they would if they were in your shoes". 
The reality of these two tasks is so different that they would in no other circumstance be part of the same job description. A private company would hire a "public relations and communications expert" for the first task and a "senior manager with expertise in a specific field" for the latter. There are cases in which a person is very qualified in both of these tasks such as Barack Obama or where a popluation actually doesn't seem to care that much about public appearance and more about what the person has done such as Angela Merkel. Unfortunately though, these cases are not without exception - maybe not even the majority - The rise of populism around the world shows that a vast majority of people is susceptible to quick-fixes, empty promises and fairy tales of "taking back control". 
Technocrats, in comparison, would be selected only for their qualifications in the second task, i.e. being a manager with expertise. Instead of spending a lot of time convincing a general population through empty promises that you know cannot be kept you have to convince a select group of experts that have more realistic expectations and a better overview over the current scientific progress. If you promise to be "tough on crime" they would hopefully point out that this has not only be unsuccessful but also counterproductive in the vast majority of cases (But the general public loves it in some parts of the world). If your goals were too ambitious and, therefore, unfulfillable, they would slow you down a bit or select someone with a more realistic proposal. 
2. **self-selection:** This mechanism is a bit more subtle but I think it has a large influence on the political landscape. Over the entire career of a politician there are certain boundaries they have to overcome to rise in the hirarchy and to do so certain skills are required. This means that the people who complete the journey have select properties that are worth exploring. 
It starts with the group of people who can even afford to become a politician. If you work two jobs to provide for your family or have to care for your younger siblings your not going to find the time to participate in your local party chapter. Having time is one of the reasons why a lot of politicians in Germany have been teachers once. But let's say you have the time and money to try it. Then there is still a lot of selection for specific personality traits. Most politicians don't start in high ranks but work their way up by either starting in low tier local offices or through the youth organizations of their respective party. And while I have never been part of such an organization myself, a lot of debating friends or StuSti people are and some of their stories are pretty nasty. Some of the members of youth organizations have watched a bit too much Game of Thrones or House of Cards and act accordingly - they play nice with you most of the time but when there is an opening they will stab you in the back. I hope and guess that most people are not like that but frequency of stories like that is definitely higher than in other parts of society. Additionally, if you want to rise up within the ranks of your party you need to connect to the mighty and powerful. Since most of the people below your ranks likely have little say in your advancements, "crawling to the bigwigs and bullying the underlings" is a successfull strategy. 
#is cooperation and altruism worth it in politics?
Since humans, at least on average, prefer overconfident people to less confident ones this will also be reflected in their ballot and in who rises up party ranks internally. Once such a systemic selection is established it perpetuates itself. The powerful people in the party have certain traits and they are more likely to choose successors similar to them. While some of characteristics are probably useful (Being determined is probably useful and necessary) most of them are not good for society at large. We have a system that selects people who are more likely to be egoistic, less cooperative and overconfident but large parts of their actual job is to cooperate with others to make altruistic decisions for society. That feels like a missmatch. Clearly, the selections I describe are not deterministic and there are a lot of positive exceptions but there is a reason why politicians are seen as egoistic and dishonest in the eyes of many. 
I also have to admit that a technocracy might inherit a lot of these problems. Connections would still play a large role and many of the just described traits might still be benefitial to rise up the ranks. However, I think the damage is mitigated to some extent. People who come from academia or NGOs should on average be more cooperative and altruistic because modern science only works with large cooperations of different people and NGOs hopefully self-select for altruistic behaviour. I hope (but sadly I'm not very sure) that peer-review and the scientific apparatus in general is more meritocratic and therefore less connection-dependent than politics. Paper reviews are double blind but "knowing someone who knows someone" can increase your chances of getting in prestigious PhD programs significantly, so it's just a minor improvement in this regard. 
#TODO: discuss with someone who is/was in a party. 

### The voters: a negative framing: people are actually dumb and cultists. systemic misunderstanding. biases: confirmation bias, dunning kruger. a positive framing: people have more important stuff to do. specialization is beneficial for everyone. 
#TODO factcheck everything. This has to be sound.
I think there are two different angles from which you can look at the voter. There is the cynic in me who has read Kahneman, Dawkins and Hanson (TODO) and has a rather grim view of people and there is the Effective Altruist in me who wants to make systems more beneficial and efficient. 
1. **A negative framing:** 
TODO
2. **A positive framing:** From a systemic perspective it is bad design when everyone has to be informed about lots of issues because it carries large opportunity cost. Instead of everyone informing themselves about different stances on immigration, health care, foreign affairs, drug policy, policing reform, religious rights, abortion, economic policy, redistrubition, tax policy, etc. you could have some individuals who specialize in their respective field and make the decisions and the rest of us could have more time to do what we are specialists for. We could refine our skills for our job, just spend more time with family and friends or play videogames. Specialization is a net benefit for all because of the comparative advantages that you can see everywhere in society. We don't need two companies that both make mediocre cars and mediocre computers but we need one company that makes good computers and one that makes good cars. Similarly, we don't need lots of mediocre informed voters to make decisions as an aggregate but rather specialized individuals that make good decisions in their domain (and some people who coordinate the specialists, obviously). 

### Politicians have short-term incentives: re-election 

### Good Policy is often not sexy: maintanance, experiments, 

### Some voters are much more important than others 

### Superficial measurement of results: most politicians don't check the results of their policies

### Elections are not very fine-grained: 4-5y 

### Some election systems have serious flaws: 50%, gerrymandering, etc. money in politics, corruption, 


## Addressing some concerns


### I am no expert on politics and biased towards academia


### A democracy is based on the will of the people


### Other solutions within the democratic framework



### Politicians have advisors



### You need accountability



### I actually don't know whether politics or academia is less biased against minorities
