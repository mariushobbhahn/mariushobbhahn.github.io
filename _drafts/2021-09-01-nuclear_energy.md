## **What is this post about?**

Nuclear energy is a very polarized issues. Either people are strong supporters or opponents. Therefore it is often hard to find unbiased non-ideological evidence and arguments about the issue. In this post, I want to look at the case for and against nuclear energy and under which conditions it makes sense to use it. 

### Summary


## We need some stable source of energy

Until we figured out storage and large scale distribution

## How safe are nuclear power plants?


## The waste problem

put it deep under the earth, e.g. salt mine

shoot into space

recycle

## What's the alternative?

TODO: OWID graphic

Does nuclear hinder renewables?

## Conclusion

should we build new ones?

should we turn them off?
