## **What is the paper about?**

Quantified uncertainty is helpful in many applications. 

examples

but is slow

new approach: make it fast and hope for the best

start with GLMs, future projects look at combinations of random variables

Important: this is the simple version; see actual paper for the real one; see github for code.

## Background 

If you understand the three pieces of background the rest is easy

## Laplace Matching

Just the simple version of it

Explain the intuition behind moment matching

Tables? probably just say that they exist?!

### LM+GPs

Figure + explanation

## Experiments

Mostly figures

## Timing and complexity

tables and high level message

## Summary
