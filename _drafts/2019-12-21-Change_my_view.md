## **What is this post about?** 

I think a core part of rationality is to regularly question your own core beliefs. This implies not only dealing with a softball attack on this belief but with its best case opposition. Many of my core beliefs are rather uncontroversial like "climate change is to a large extend influenced by humans". There are also beliefs that I do not hold but I can understand how other people could reasonably not agree with like "A relationship must always feel like it could last forever to be good". I personally think a relationship can be positive for both partners even if you do not expect it to last forever but I can see how some people prefer to believe it will last forever. This post is supposed to be about the beliefs that I currently hold of which I do not understand the best case opposition. At least not the one that I am currently aware of. Therefore I ask you to help me question my beliefs. If anyone thinks they understand the opposition to any of my views I would invite them to tell me via their prefered means of communication. I will post the answers that I find new or educational under the corresponding subsection (anonymous or with credit, whatever the author prefers).

### Not pulling the lever

In the trolley thought experiment there are five people strapped to one track and one person strapped to another. A track switch links the tracks in such a way that an incoming train would either kill the five people or the one person. The switch is set per default in such a way that it would kill the five people. However, you could actively flip the switch such that the train will run over the one person instead of the five. You do not know any of the six people being strapped on the train and you can also not infer anything about them. To you they are just random people. As someone who is rather consequentialist, to me the answer seems rather straight forward: five is larger than one and therefore we should flip the switch to save five and lose only one person. I also do not see the large difference between action and inaction since you are responsible for the death of the five via omission. Therefore inaction does not seem like a legitimate excuse to me. 
But, at least to my understanding, also other ethical streams would argue in favour of flipping the switch. A Rawlsian Fairness approach would flip the switch since behind the veil of ignorance you would want everyone to flip the switch since it reduced your chance of dying from 5/6 to 1/6. A Kantian would also want to flip the switch since they would approve of a universal rule to flip the switch for the same reason as in the Rawls framework. So far I have never heard an explanation that made me think: "Ah I see why you would not flip the switch even though I would". Maybe someone can explain it to me.
