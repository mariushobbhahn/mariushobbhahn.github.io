## **What is this post about?**

TODO short overview

Looks like a lot but feels like little. 

### Disclaimers


### Scientist of papermaker?


### Ambition in academia

One the one hand, everyone pretends to be unambitious while being very ambitious + intelligent.

On the other hand, the ambition is weird. Mostly path dependencies + rationalization. Little high-level thinking about why stuff is important. "What is the theory of change / impact / whatever" is seen as insult, not as help. For some projects it's just clear that nobody ever asked why it would matter. I'm guilty of that too. Keeping busy rather than doing something that matters. 

### Work on the basics

Git, coding practices, etc. 

### Content is the best motivation

Chasing a citation == bad; wanting to share something you found == good; 

### How we compare methods is broken

Currently everyone is asked to compare against other methods. Bad training for rest, mega training for mine TADA. Either, allow people to say their method doesn't beat everything else and make sure they actually train the other methods reasonably or allow them to publish with less comparisons. SQ == worst of both worlds

### Trade-off between reading a lot and finding new ideas

It's not obvious that you should read everything that everyone else has done. 

### Every paper is two papers in one

One for readers who just want to get a gist and another for people who want to reproduce the results. 

### Who is responsible for feedback and when?

writing a paper / thesis, unfinished, need feedback, supervisor has more ideas -> should give me feedback, but not finished -> doesn't want to give feedback on the unfinished version. 
Both frustrated with the outcome. Bad. > Better to go as far as possible and mark questions. 

### TODO reviews

If you suggest experiments, it has to be clear why. If you suggest citations it has to be clear why. It's not that hard to review but still most people do it wrong. 

### Collaborate with others. It's usually good.


### We are missing a crucial form of information sharing

Something between twitter and a paper. A short blogpost. But it doesn't get any reward so most people don't do it.
