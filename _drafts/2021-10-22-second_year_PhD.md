## **What is this post about?**

TODO short overview

EDS, wrote a new paper, have some new ideas, collab with AMF?
Looks like a lot but feels like little. 

### Disclaimers

Covid, Philipp is good, etc. 

### Scientist of papermaker?

Most intense love-hate relationship of my life. I love science, the exploration, the knowledge gain, the feeling of improving the world step by step. I hate the politics of academia, parts of the review system, the expectation that you do everything "for science" while getting a bad salary with bad working hours, etc. 

It's actually hard because so easy to rationalize "just guiding their attention, can't check everything, everyone does it and thus knows about it, etc." ... 

Pattern is "how can we get this through review" not how can we increase knowledge / value for others. It's like the high-brow version of Instagram "bro, yesterday I did 50 push ups, for real!" but with more figures and tables.  In my mind the reviewers have become the gatekeepers to good science not their facilitators. I don't know what the solution is. So far I just write an honest shorter version of the paper on my blog. 

### Ambition in academia is weird

One the one hand, everyone pretends to be unambitious while being very ambitious + intelligent.

On the other hand, the ambition is weird. Mostly path dependencies + rationalization. Little high-level thinking about why stuff is important. "What is the theory of change / impact / whatever" is seen as insult, not as help. For some projects it's just clear that nobody ever asked why it would matter. I'm guilty of that too. Keeping busy rather than doing something that matters. 

### Content is the best motivation

Chasing a citation == bad; wanting to share something you found == good; 

### How we compare methods is broken

Currently everyone is asked to compare against other methods. Bad training for rest, mega training for mine TADA. Either, allow people to say their method doesn't beat everything else and make sure they actually train the other methods reasonably or allow them to publish with less comparisons. SQ == worst of both worlds

### I changed my mind about specialization

It's just so fucking boring. 

Depends on what your goal is. Details will be worked out by private actors. Your goals change over the time of your research.

Artificially constraining yourself is bad.

### Every paper is two papers in one

One for readers who just want to get a gist and another for people who want to reproduce the results. 

### It's very tough to know how well you are doing



### Who is responsible for feedback and when?

writing a paper / thesis, unfinished, need feedback, supervisor has more ideas -> should give me feedback, but not finished -> doesn't want to give feedback on the unfinished version. 
Both frustrated with the outcome. Bad. > Better to go as far as possible and mark questions. 

### TODO reviews

If you suggest experiments, it has to be clear why. If you suggest citations it has to be clear why. It's not that hard to review but still most people do it wrong. 

### Collaborate with others. It's usually good.


### We are missing a crucial form of information sharing

Something between twitter and a paper. A short blogpost. But it doesn't get any reward so most people don't do it. 

### Papers are partly about looks

Papers are about information sharing. If the plot is unreadable that's bad. This manifests in an expectation, see Philipps way to create plots. "you see some lines and some numbers, that should be enough". But I really WANT to understand Philipp's plots. 

### Work on the basics

Git, coding practices, etc.
