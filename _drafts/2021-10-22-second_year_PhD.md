## **What is this post about?**

TODO short overview

EDS, wrote a new paper, have some new ideas, 
Looks like a lot but feels like little. 

### Disclaimers

I have the same disclaimers as last year
1. I started my PhD right when Covid began. Therefore, my experience might differ a lot from the usual PhD experience. I haven't been to a large in person conference yet and I don't like the online versions. So I probably just know less people to collaborate with or learn from than other people would at my stage of the PhD. 
2. Some of the following bullet points are negative. My struggles, however, are mostly with the academia as a system and not with the people around me. I still feel happy in my group and I'm ever more convinced that Philipp is a great supervisor (probably >95th percentile for me). For example, he really cares that we are doing well in our PhD both content-wise and mentally, e.g. he sends out feedback forms), and he gives us the level of supervision we want to have, e.g. doesn't micromanage unless asked to and let's us explore as long as it's broadly reasonable. 

### I started suboptimally

I started my PhD by extending my Master thesis and turning it into a paper. Furthermore, Philipp had a very concrete idea in mind for the beginning of my PhD and it fit neatly with the Master thesis so that was my second project. So I started with two relatively structured projects that were both intended to result in a paper, sounds good, right? It was good but I think it resulted in too little exploration. My previous and my current project are more along the lines of "I have an abstract idea, let's play around and see whether I can make it work" and I think I learned more this way. 

Obviously, you should do both exploration and exploitation during your PhD, but if I had to do it again, I would probably do more exploration earlier. Just pick some papers that I find interesting, reimplement their method and play around with it. Try to get and intuitive feeling for the method and understand it on a nuts and bolts level. I think I could also have approaches my first two projects differently, taking more time to play around and starting to write the paper later on. I'm pretty sure that different people have different needs in this regard. I don't struggle with structure and am eager to get stuff done, so more exploration is needed. For others it might be the other way round. 

Btw, exploration doesn't mean randomly doing things. You can and should do exploration in a structured way. The focus is just much more on understanding the method really deeply without thinking about how you could present it in the eventual paper. 

### Scientist of papermaker?

Academia is the most intense love-hate relationship of my life. I love science, the exploration, the knowledge gain and the feeling of improving the world step by step. I hate the politics of academia, parts of the review system and the expectation that you do everything "for science" while getting a bad salary (compared to market rates). I am personally convinced that the vast majority of scientists I interact with have good intentions. I know that they are in there to improve the world step by step. On the other hand, there is this nagging voice in my head constantly saying "The incentives are unaligned with truth-seeking, how are we supposed to do science when we are rewarded for so many things that have nothing to do with it?". 

I find the situation hard because it's easy to rationalize both ways. In case your paper gets accepted, the system works because "it saw your genius", in case the paper gets rejected, the system is broken because "reviewers are closed-minded". You always have to select the information to put into the paper, so it's easy to say "I'm just guiding the reviewers attention" rather than "I'm tricking the reviewer by not showing the negative results". You could also always argue "Everyone is presents their results in the best light. It's fine when that I'm doing it as well" or "I'll just do it until I'm in the position to change things". I also realised that, in my head, the perception of the reviewers has slowly changed from the facilitators of good science to their gatekeepers (at least some of them) and I think this is a pretty bad association to have. 

I'm not really sure how to resolve this struggle to be very honest. Since I'm not dead set on staying in academia, I intend to just write papers when I'm very convinced that I have found something important and present them in a more honest light---you know, reporting the limitations, not ignoring the negative results, etc. For now, I'm presenting a more honest version of the paper in my blog posts. When I think something that I found is just a marginal improvement or only applicable in fringe scenarios, I'll say so on my blog. 

### Ambition in academia is weird

On the one hand, many academics pretend to be unambitious while we are clearly one of the most intelligent and ambitious groups in society by whatever metric you want to choose. This doesn't have any major implications, I'm just not sure why this narrative exists. 

On the other hand, some forms of practiced ambition are also weird. For example, ambition is often equated with how hard a project is and not with how it would lead to actual improvements. So, I think ambitious academics should spend more time on thinking about the theory of change/impact/what they think is important and less time in engaging in signalling their ambition by choosing hard but potentially useless projects. In my experience, the best papers often have a very simple idea or goal and execute this really well. If a paper makes the idea seem simple but still provides relevant theoretical or practical improvements, it's probably a good paper. 

### Content is the best motivation

This will sound cheesy but it's still true. Chasing a publication or citations is a bad motivator. It might keep you motivated for a couple of months but at some point you will think "I just want this to be over with and get it done". I was much more motivated for my latest project because it felt more like "I found something that I want to share with the community". It's just much easier to work in feedback, etc. because my primary goal is to make other people understand the method. 

### How we compare methods is broken

How we (ML people) compare methods in our papers is broken. Currently, it is expected that you compare your new method to a range of other methods. Since most of them require costly fine-tuning and your chances of acceptance decrease if your method isn't better than the others, everyone is incentiviced to compare their fine-tuned work with the non-tuned benchmarks. This is clearly bad because it pretends to compare but actually doesn't. 

I see multiple paths out of this problem. Either a) you explicitly ask people to fine-tune the baselines and trust them to do it or b) you stop punishing people for not beating the state of the art or c) you decrease the importance of baselines and increase the importance of other evidence such as case-studies, etc. I would argue that a good paper shouldn't solely consist of benchmark comparisons anyway and it would be good to remove the expectation of beating the state of the art in every paper so I'd go for a mix of them. 

### Organising Academic events

I have organised events for the debate club in the past. These were large events with more than 100 attendants and they obviously required some effort. So I expected to be well-prepared for lead-organising the 2021 Ellis doctoral symposium, a new event we created to get new PhDs together during covid. But I was very wrong! I easily spent hundreds of hours organizing and I was only one of ~10 PhDs. 

There are a ton of rules that make it harder to spend public money. For every major spending point you need to make a public bidding and find at least 3 competitors. For every cent you spend, you have to fill a form and provide reasoning. In theory, this system is in place to prevent fraud. In practice, people know how to circumvent and bend the rules to get the desired results anyway. We, as the PhDs, would have been completely lost without the help of multiple admins who know how to navigate the system. But I also feel bad for them since they have to spend so much time filling forms and creating documents for small spending points. 

I'd guess that these rules are in place because there was rampant misuse in the past. But it still sucks that the 95% of people who just want to organise a good event have to pay the prize for the 5% who abused the system. I think there are some ways to improve the system but it feels like a very sticky problem to me. 

### I changed my mind a bit about specialization

In the previous post, I recommended to broadly stick to the same topic in your PhD since your benefits accumulate and you build more expertise. I still think this is true but I want to emphasize more that it is a trade-off. 

If you realise that your original research is not as useful as predicted, something else is much more important, someone else has already solved it or you are bored by it, you should switch. In my personal case, I have come to the conclusion that AI alignment is very important and therefore I pivoted further towards exploring the role of Bayesian ML for AI safety. I think my early work is also relevant for AI safety but I feel like there is an important niche that that is currently undervalued which I want to fill.

### Every paper is two papers in one

Broadly speaking, there are two types of readers of your paper. Firstly, there are people who just want to understand the big picture. They don't care about the exact setup of your experiments and just want to see a nice figure explaining the idea. For them, speed is more important than accuracy. Secondly, there are people who really want to understand the paper and potentially reproduce it. They care a lot about the exact setup of your experiments and what every single symbol means. For them, accuracy is much more important than speed. 

I think it's easy to fall into the trap of writing a paper for either of these two groups while forgetting the other. Most of the time, since your reviewers care about the details, we tend to forget that most people will just skim the abstract, look at one or two figures and leave. If your paper can't be understood this way, you'll lose 80% of your audience without ever knowing. I think papers that manage this split well usually care about conceptual figures, put a lot of the details in the appendix and provide their code publicly. Thus, I'm not forced to care about the details but I could check them if I wanted to. 

### It's very tough to know how well you are doing

During school, Bachelor's and Master's you regularly get some feedback. You get grades, you see how well your friends are doing, etc. During the PhD, I found this much harder. The review process is very stochastic, so using it as feedback is very noisy. You could writes lots of papers but they might all be bad and you could write only one paper but it is very good. I have talked to other PhDs and they have reported similar struggles. 

I think the main take-aways are a) talk about your struggles and especially your solutions with other PhDs (everyone struggles in some way even if it's not the exact same way as yours) and b) have high-level meetings with your supervisor from time to time, e.g. every year. In this meeting you should not talk about content at all but just about how you're doing, what went well and bad and exchange constructive feedback. Supervisors usually want to see you do well, so the bottleneck is mostly them not knowing in which ways you struggle. Once they know, they usually have good feedback. Supervisors probably have the best overview of what you are doing and how it compares to the reference class, so their opinion should be valuable for you.

### Who is responsible for feedback and when?

I have come across the following situation in multiple scenarios. "A student works on their paper and sends it to the supervisor for feedback. The supervisor looks at the paper, realizes that it feels unfinished from their perspective and sends it back with a constructive version of 'you can do better. Iterate a bit more'. The student thinks they already did their best and it's the responsibility of the supervisor to help them out and the supervisor thinks it's the students responsibility to provide them with a better first draft." Another situation I have witnessed, this time as the supervisor, was "A student sends me their draft and I send it back with detailed comments. They work in the comments, hand in the thesis and I + my professor grade it. Their grade is not perfect and they are confused. They expected that my feedback was a list of all the possible things they needed to do to get the best grade rather than just the most important comments on their current version. 

I think the conclusion from this is mostly that there is a lot of miscommunication around feedback and responsibilities. Thus, the most important thing is to be clearer whether you are the student or supervisor. As the supervisor, I will clarify that my feedback should not be seen as a list of *all possible* feedback and as a student I will clarify at what stage the paper is and which kind of feedback I want, e.g. by adding comments like "Is this section clear?", in the text.
