## **What is this post about?**

Inspired by the US election and the couple of months prior I thought a lot about US culture. More specifically, I wanted to understand why US citizens behave so differently than European ones when it comes to their patriotism or their party. And while there are many important factors such as historic differences, a completely broken two party system with an electoral college that incentivices polarization or a privatized news sector that mostly repeats their party line some of the explanation is probably found in the different cultures and mentalities. The narrative of the American Dream probably explains some of the voting behaviour of the average American which shows less solidarity with others than the average European vote. IS THIS TRUE OR JUST MY BIAS? Unrelated ot that I was also thinking a bit about company culture. This was mainly inspired by two podcast with Netflix founder Reed Hastings, one on <a href='https://freakonomics.com/podcast/book-club-hastings/'>Freakonomics radio</a> and one on <a href='https://freakonomics.com/podcast/book-club-hastings/'>Masters of Scale</a>. The more I thought about the two different areas, the more I asked myself which aspects of the two I find desirable and whether there are commonalities between them that can be extrapolated to other areas of life as well. 

Just to be clear, when I say culture I do not mean the artistic, musical or historic connotation as in Beethoven, Da Vinci or the Romans but rather the group mentality component. So for the purpose of this post I will define culture as a norm or system of beliefs that many people within a social group share. Examples for this include culture within a country, such as the American Dream, culture within a company, such as Netflix, or culture within a social bubble, such as people who identify as Effective Altruists. 

In the rest of the post I want to analyse different aspects of different cultures specifically under the lense of game theory. I choose the focus of game theory because I think it has great explanatory power for the resulting behavior of the people within that culture and is greatly undervalued in public debates or personal conversation. In the end I want to pick out some aspects of culture that I think are generally positive and I would emphasize if I have the chance to create a new culture from scratch or choose in new surroundings. 

## Analysing different cultures

Analysis for why this is based on culture not just rational

### Ideologies

Populist politicians and people who vote for populist parties have to assume that the world is a zero-sum game for their ideology and actions to make sense. This means that whenever you lose something others are gaining and whenever others are gaining you necessarily lose. If more immigrants come into your country and improve their quality of life in a zero-sum mindset this means that you have to lose something as a consequence, e.g. the immigrants steal your jobs or decrease the value of your culture (now in the historical sense). If the elites increase their wealth that must imply that yours is diminished. In a zero-sum mindset there is no room for someone winning while others are winning too. If a minority gets more rights or more protection from the government this has to imply that your rights are infringed upon. 

In contrast, in a liberal and globalist mindset most games are positive-sum, i.e. it is possible that both parties profit even if one profits more than another. Unter this mindset immigrants can improve their quality of life while not harming yours or potentially even increase it by enriching your culture (in the other sense). The increasing wealth of elites is not necessarily seen as a negative as a rising tide can lift all boats and the minority can be protected without you being harmed. 

Obviously this is fairly simplistic and there will be populists who don't have a zero-sum mentality and liberals who don't think the world is a positive-sum game and some people will switch depending on the situation. But on average you will probably find a zero-sum culture when you surround yourself with populists and a positive-sum culture in the liberal camp. 

### International Relations

The way in which trade, negotions and other international relations are handled is not only determined by rational calculations but to a large extend by the mentality of the leader and the culture among the political decision makers within a given country. For example, if you find yourself in a prisoners dilemma type situation with another country whether you cooperate or not is not only determined by the facts and information that your intelligence agency provides but also by the trust and average level of paranoia that your political leaders have. If your leadership culture is mostly based around the fear that other countries try to fuck you over rather than engage in mutually benefitial trade you are more likely to defect. 

Different approaches to international relations can again be split along the zero-sum vs. positive-sum axis. Donald Trumps philosophy to governance (if it exists) seems to be mostly based on a zero-sum assumption. His trade war doesn't make any sense from a classical (and reasonable) economic perspective because trade is a positive-sum game. If you view trade through the zero-sum lense, however, a trade war can seem plausible. If China loses more (e.g. GPD) than you during the trade war this is a net gain for you. Similarly, the cold-war-esque approach to IR by Putin seems to be also based largely on a zero-sum understanding of the world. Vetoing actions in the UN security council that are mostly independent of Russia or supporting most enemies of the West makes a lot of sense if you think that every harm you do to the USA is a win for Russia. 

Most Western Countries seem to have a largely positive-sum view of IR. In tendency, they want to reduce trade-barriers to create mutual prosperity or stop global warming even if it means to take on short term costs.

Prisoners dilemma or tragedy of the commons type situations can again be greatly influences by the group mentality of the decision makers. The most prominent example for this is climate change but it similarly applies to e.g. denuclearization. The fight against climate change only works if all countries work together. Everyone needs to take costs now (e.g. economic output drops because of stricter regulation) to ensure the common good in the future. If one party defects, e.g. by leaving the Paris climate accords, they get an unfair economic advantage over the others because they don't bear the cost of regulations and thereby create an incentive for all others to leave as well. The probability of success of such coordination problems with around 200 players is very much dependent on the culture of every single player (i.e. country). If your culture is one that yields high trust in other governments it is very willing to coordinate and solve the tragedy of the commons through cooperation. If your culture is based around fear and paranoia, e.g. because you expect other countries to exploit or trick you, it is significantly harder to cooperate and more likely that you defect. 

### Country-wide cultural beliefs

There are many different cultural beliefs that influence our decision making process such as the average openness or trust. However, I want to focus primarily on the average degree to which people believe their success is determined by chance compared to other (often random) factors such as birth, race or luck because I think it has a pretty large influence on everyday interactions.

The more your culture is on the American Dream side of the spectrum, i.e. high individual responsibility and low credit to other factors, the stronger two effects occur.

Firstly, it disincentivises risk-diversifying behaviour, e.g. redistribution or health care. The more you believe that you are the architect of your own fortune, the more you see your success as winning and helping others as losing. They could have worked hard themselves instead of living on the fruit of your labor, right? A culture that emphasizes external factors more, in contrast, decreases this perception of winning and losing. You don't lose money by helping someone in need you just counterbalance their bad luck - it could have been you after all. Once again, the more people believe in one or the other culture the more they act according to it and support or oppose e.g. diversified health care or redistribution.

Secondly, it emphasizes the zero-sum parts of society instead of the positive-sum ones. The more your culture focuses on individuals being responsible for their own success the more the culture will emphasize individual success stories. Popular movies and books are more likely to tell stories of people who rose from nothing to the high echelons of society or the media will focus on the personal actions and achievements of important people such as the president instead of their privileged upbringing or their influential friends. I don't think this relation is necessarily causal but it definitly correlates empirically. A focus on success is a focus on the zero-sum parts of society. There are, often per definition, a limited number of positions with high social status in society as they are often defined by rarity. If becoming a doctor or working at Google was less competetive it would be less impressive. A limited number of slots automatically implies a zero-sum game. If I get the spot and win someone else doesn't get the slot and loses. Similarly, if someone else wins I can't win too as the slot is taken. A culture that focuses less on individual success and thereby less on limited goods within society has more room to focus on unlimited goods and positive-sum scenarios. And, honestly, there are a lot of positive-sum games in society. Most moderate interpretations of religion are positive-sum - you can practice your religion and others can practice theirs and both of you can be happy. Education can be positive-sum - other people can get smarter without you getting dumber and vice versa. Families are positive-sum - both of us can have happy families without losing anything. However, all of the just named things can also be seen as zero-sum games depending on the culture you are in. Religions have fought many wars because of a zero-sum interpretation - if my god is right, your's can't be right too. If I aggressively post pictures of my happy family on Facebook every day then others might be less happy because their kids can't speak three languages and play five instruments while winning the state junior championship in two sports (but they are still broken inside because there is an Asian kid who is even better). 

### Companies

Different cultures within companies also emphasize either zero-sum or positive-sum aspects of their employees' lives. Honoring an employee of the month is zero-sum as only one person can get it, honoring all employees who perform better than a threshold is potentially positive-sum as multiple people could get it. It might still be a bad idea though, because all those who didn't get it might feel bad about themselves. Emphasizing that people who work hard climb the ladder is zero-sum as there are usually only limited places higher up. This also means that if other people within your team perform worse, because you sabotage their work or communicate badly, you are incentiviced to be uncooperative and a dick. Saying that everyone gets a raise proportional to the quality of their work is positive-sum and incentivices cooperation as everyone can win and teamwork usually pays off. Clearly, there are some parts of a company that are zero-sum games - only one person can be CEO and you can't promote everyone. I think it's just important to realize that different company cultures induce completely different incentive structures which can lead to massive performance gaps between companies. 

### Social Groups

By social group I mean a community that is connected through a specific purpose and regularly spends time together, e.g. a football club, a band, a group of friends playing online video games, a debating club or the Effective Altruism community. In the case of social groups there is a game theory element that inherently exists through the design of the group. A football match is by definition zero-sum - one team wins and the other one loses. A band is with high probability positive-sum and so on. The other aspect comes from the culture of the group, i.e. the mentality of the people and which aspects of their purpose they choose to emphasize. Being the fan of an average quality football club would be pretty useless if you focused on the zero-sum aspects. Half of the time you would go home happy because you won and the other half of the time you would be sad because you lost. Therefore, fans claim wins as the merit of their team but externalize the losses by blaming the referee, the weather or the stadium. Additionally, the culture of a football club largely centers around positive-sum aspects. The game itself is only a small aspect compared to the community, the experiences and the stories you get to share. All of these can exist in multiple football clubs at the same time and the fans can be happy even if their club loses all the time. 

I also want to analyze the culture and my mentality within the three social groups that I have spent the majority of my time in the last five years. The first is competetive debating, which is honestly a pretty bad deal if you only focus on results. On most tournaments 40 teams or more compete for around 8 spots in the break and only one can win the entire thing. But for the first couple of years I mostly focused on the zero-sum part of debating - I desperately wanted to perform well and, since I didn't, felt pretty miserable most of the time. At some point it got so bad that I decided a pretty drastic change was necessary if I want to keep doing this. I decided to focus more on the positive-sum parts and the entire experience was immediatly more fun. This means focusing on improvements rather than results, spending time with the people you like within the community or have interesting discussions between the rounds. The zero-sum vs. positive-sum split wasn't something I saw at the time but retroactively it fits very well into this framework. 

The second community is Effective Altruism. I think from the very first moment the EA vibe was very positive-sum and cooperation oriented. Everyone I met on my first conference was pretty nice and patiently answered my naive questions while showing me this entirely new way of thinking about the world. Whenever I am with a bunch of dedicated EAs I naturally get this feeling of unity where everyone works together on the unified goal to make the world a better place in the most effective way possible. 

The third community is academia which is a bit of a mixed bag. Science as a concept is as positive-sum as it could get. Many people come together and cooperate to understand the universe and improve society through their research. However, the process of doing science, i.e. academia is not always aligned with that. In many circumstances the culture within academia focuses more on its zero-sum aspects and competition rather than its positive-sum ones and cooperation. At least in Machine Learning the review process of the big conferences is often thought of as a author vs. reviewer game where you have to convince the reviewer to accept your paper to "win" because so much prestige is connected to acceptance on big conferences. A culture that would emphasize positive-sum aspects would frame the review process as cooperative, e.g. the reviewer and the author improve the paper together to further its content and understandability. 

### Personal Relationships

Relationships with your significant other should be positive-sum and cooperative!!! Everything else should really make you rethink your communication and behaviour within that relationship. Practically speaking this means that if you are having an argument with your partner you should not have a zero-sum mentality where you try to "win the argument" while they "lose" it where future arguments follow the same pattern but rather as a positive-sum game where one of the two "discovers" a problem that can be solved by working together and both parties win. In a zero-sum understanding of a relationship only one person can win but over time both of them probably lose. In a positive-sum understanding both can win by improving their relationship in a cooperative fashion. 

Relationships with other people should, in my opinion, also be positive-sum and cooperative but have a lower treshold for defection than a relationship with your significant other. So when interacting with friends and colleagues one should, a priori, have a positive-sum and cooperative mentality and also signal this to the respective person or group. However, when it becomes clear that the other person has a zero-sum or non-cooperative approach you will have to adapt. If you are working on a group project, for example, and another person is constantly leaning on your generocity by rarely contributing and mostly leaching, you have to adapt or there will be more exploitation in the future. If a friend uses you mostly as an emotional dump whenever they have problems in their lives but does not return the favour you should adapt or you will be exploited further. Adaption in both cases doesn't mean warfare. You should not bitch about that person behind their back or try to "win" the zero-sum game they are playing in some other way. 

## Why should I care about this?

Culture really matters. Hard to escape and you will be the weird person. 

You have to adapt - often to the dumbest player

Why does this matter to me?

Tit for tat & getting exploited
