## **What is this post about?**

Purpose: help others who struggle and expose myself for improvement

Mini-overview of the content of my PhD. 

Big caveat: covid, working alone on a project

I think Philipp is great

PhD is harder than I thought

Supervisor student relationship: more initiative and less doing what you are told

Really prepare meetings with Supervisor and gently take control

Paper writing
-True, understandable, concise
-Iterate yourself
-make it shorter
-get feedback early on (and give a lot of feedback)

Academia is slightly broken

Pick projects that you really care about -> say no to a lot of projects
kill your darlings -> look for things that could end the project
