## **What is this post about?**

The question of how to manage your personal finance as an Effective Altruist has been with me since I joined the movement. At some point in time I was convinced that I should live on Huel and cheap Pasta to maximize the amount of money I am able to donate and at other points I was convinced that I should save all my money and donate upon my death because of compound interest. However, these beliefs were mostly based on selective information or overprioritized a specific conviction that I had at the time. Therefore, I felt like I had to do more research about the EA financial landscape and think harder about the possible trajectories of my life. 

The result of that thinking is this blog post in which I want to balance the EA principles and responsible financial habits. I also want to make my strategy transparent and hold myself accountable. So if you think that there are flaws in my assumptions or my inference please contact me as this is an important decision that I want to optimize as much as possible. 

TLDR: Spend money to save time, donate money to prevent value drift and save up the rest in a financially responsible manner (e.g. ETFs).

## Assumptions


A assumption that is very crucial for my logic is that **time is more important than money**. The reasons come from two different angles presented in the following. 

### EA perspective



### Age preferences


## Short-term spending

Spend money to save time

Spend money to remove annoyances / improve your well-being

Donate a certain amount because a) taxes & giving tuesdays, b) value drift

track your spending

## Long-term saving

save or donate?
a) see framing
b) uncertainty matters: bad times, start-ups, NGOs, etc.

save in ETFs: Use one that excludes the really bad stuff

## Conclusions
