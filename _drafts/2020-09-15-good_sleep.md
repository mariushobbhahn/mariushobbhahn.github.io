## **What is this post about?**

Over the summer of 2020 I slept pretty bad for a long period of time and it had pretty noticable effects on my productivity, perceived energy levels and well-being in general. This was mostly due to the fact that my room was under the southern roof of the house and it had around 28 degrees celcius during "cool" summer nights which made it effectively impossible for me to get more than 6 hours of light sleep per night. In autumn, I moved to a new flat where I had to get a new bed, matress, pillow, etc. 

Since I had felt the negative consequences of bad sleep pretty recently, I figured I could conduct a bit of research and use science to improve my own sleep. In the following you can find a distilled summary of what I found with respect to the right equipment and sleep hygene. 

A last piece of framing that I want to provide before diving into the main part is with regards to the money and effort people should be willing to spend and invest to improve their sleep. The longer I thought about this question the more I thought the right answer should be: "a lot". Just think of the effect that good vs. bad sleep has on your life and quantify it roughly. Let's be very conservative with our estimates and assume the difference of good vs. bad sleep results in 30 more productive minutes per day. If you value your time at the level of minimum wage which is around 10€ (as a conservative estimate) this means you should be willing to pay up to 5€ per day. Over a year that makes 5 * 365 = 1825€. If you additionally consider all the negative side effects of bad sleep this number gets larger very quickly. If you have, for example, a matress that is way too soft for you, your spine might suffer from this. This can have large consequences to the rest of your life, e.g. while sitting in a chair, driving a car or during sports. Treating these outcomes, which are often only visibles after years and take a long time to fix, is often very expensive financially and emotionally draining or painful. A second example would be our perceived well-being throughout the day. I think we all know that there is a noticable difference between a day after a good night and a bad one. One day feels slow, annoying and unproductive while the other feels faster, more energetic and more productive. While this is harder to quantify financially it is still something that I would be willing to put a lot of effort in to improve consistently. 

## The right bed 

There are a lot of guides out there telling you how to choose the right mattress, pillow, blanket, bed frame, etc. to optimize your sleep. In this chapter, I want to give a broad overview over the different options and how confident we should be in this advice. 

Unfortunately though, I have to start this section with bad news. There is only very little solid and reliable research on the topic of mattresses. <a href='https://www.vice.com/en/article/aekgk4/science-wont-help-you-pick-a-better-mattress'>This Vice article</a> gives a pretty concise summary over the state of research and the problems attached to it. Basically it says that a) research about sleep is always very expensive since you have to distribute a lot of matresses to a lot of people, b) it is therefore often funded by big matress companies who have their own interests and the results should be approached with caution and c) private research or privately sponsored research often yields rather imprecise results such as "on average people prefered the medium-firm matress to the firm one". But then most matress companies have their own rating system and there is no unified measurement so results from one company don't necessarily translate another. The one trustworthy study that the authors found concluded that no matress is clearly superior to any other in general but for every individual person there are better or worse matresses. TODO:transition

Keeping in mind that they are not research backed but should rather be interpreted as experience-based heuristics at best, we can look at the recommendations made by people who sell mattresses for a living. <a href='https://sleepopolis.com/guides/how-to-choose-a-mattress/'>This guide</a> gave me a good overview of the parameters that you can choose and should be aware of when buying a new one. The articles main points are a) the parameters that matter most are your sleeping position, your weight, and your prefered firmness. Depending on them you should get a soft or firmer matress. b) Mattresses are made of different materials. There is memory foam, latex, innerspring, and hybrid models. Each of which has its advantages and disadvantages with respect to sleep feeling and living age of the mattress. c) You shouldn't buy mattresses online. Go to a local store and test out different models. Really lie down for five minutes or longer per mattress that could suite you because otherwise you might miss something. If you don't know exactly what the parameters of your mattress are (which most people don't) you have to try it out which is harder to do online. d) Quality comes with price. It might not be a perfect predictor and you will find some outliers but usually a more expensive mattress will give you a better sleeping experience. As with most products the price for quality curve flattens down the higher the price gets but given that it will have a non-negligible impact on the average quality of sleep over your next 8-10 years you should aim too low. 

There are also different fancy <a href='http://ergonomictrends.com/best-ergonomic-pillows/'>ergonomic pillows</a> and <a href='https://www.thespruce.com/guide-to-buying-blankets-350480'>blankets</a>. In both cases you will find wild claims about how the right choice of either can drastically improve your sleep and decrease negative conditions such as neck pain. However, once again, the research seems to be based to a large extend on privately sponsored or privately conducted research which we should treat with caution.

## Conclusions

Sleep is very very individual but you can improve your own sleep after finding out what your preferences are. 

Money isn't the solution
