## What is this post about?

In the following I want to share the many reasons for a vegetarian/vegan diet. They range from animal suffering over global food distribution considerations to climate change and more. Additionally, I want to show how it is possible and easy to switch diets without any loss of quality of life. TLDR; please don't eat meat - it's really bad for everyone.

## 1 Reasons against eating animal products

I think most people have heard that animals are held in bad conditions, that meat is less effective than other kinds of food on a energy per gram measure, that meat uses a lot of water during production, etc. However, during most of the discussions I personally had, heard or read about the topic there were astonishingly little numbers and weighings involved. To exaggerate - you are either a Nazi for eating meat or you are a Nazi for taking away someones freedom to eat meat. Therefore I want to focus mostly on the size of the effects w.r.t. a certain topic and explain it in a more understandable manner, i.e. what it means if billions of animals are slaughtered every year or a kilo of red meat uses 10000 liters of water. 

### 1.1 Animal Suffering

I think the most obvious but also most impactful problem with an animal diet is the animal suffering it creates. To give a broad overview over the current state of meat consumption consider the following figures.

</figure>

From this follow two observations: a) The number of animals killed per year increases pretty drastically, the growth of chickens killed for consumption looks exponential and that for pigs linear. We obviously do not know if that will continue but we do know that consumption has not always been this high. Given that meat is a status symbol in many countries and poverty goes down this is a likely indicator for a still growing trend. b) The global meat consumption is actually extremely high. Assuming that the world has around 7 Billion inhabitants this would imply that on average a person eats roughly eight chickens and a fifth of a pig. This gets even bigger when considering that many countries do not consume a lot of meat either due to poverty or to religous reasons. The conditions in which animals are held are horrible for the vast majority of cases. TODO: orgs and sustainable doesnt matter.
However my main focus is less on exposing these conditions but rather on arguing what they mean in more comprehensive terms. In the Holocaust <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_concentration_camps#Total_number_of_camps_and_casualties'>approximately 17 Million</a> people were murdered. 
If we think that a chicken has a 16/58000 = 0.00028th of the moral worth of a human this means humanity commits one Holocaust every year on Chickens alone. Similarly, in the Rwandan genocide an estimated <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwandan_genocide#Death_toll_and_timeline'>1.074 Million</a> atrocities were counted. If we think that a pig has the moral worth of 1.074/14700 = 0.073th of a human, we commit a Rwandan genocide every year on pigs alone. Obviously these are very rough approximations; these events might be singular in nature, a year in concentration camp might be very different from one year in a factory farm, etc. However just comparing these numbers opened my eyes. The number of animals humans kill and eat every year is just incredibly huge. Additionally, if someone had asked me before comparing the numbers about my intuitive estimate of the moral worth of an animal compared to a human, I would have given way higher answers for both, chickens and pigs. Overall, even if your estimate of the moral worth of an animal is lower or you think the comparison is lower, we can probably agree that the huge amount of animal suffering created every year is too large.

## 2 How to effectively change your diet?

Most of the time when I present any of the above arguments to someone who is currently eating meat I get one of the following responses: "I know it is bad but I just like the taste so much that I don't care about the rest", "I should eat less meat but it is just so engrained in my family etc. that I cannot change their habits" or "I agree with everything and I will start eating less meat next year "(which then does not happen) - just to show some possible answers. Even though these might seem like unreasonable responses to some, I think all of them have one of multiple underlying reasons that I want to address in the following. These reasons might be irrational fears, the person might be biased in some way or just lack some information. However, independent of the validity of the source of their current reasoning, effective change can only happen if this particular reason is addressed. Acknowledging the problem is often the easy part when compared to an actual change of actions. 

### 2.1 Is there a Case against Meat? 

I think the first step has to be a form of moral questioning. Basically ask yourself whether one of the above arguments - or any other argument against eating meat - is valid. This question is best asked in a vacuum, i.e. without conciderations of political motives, possible drawbacks (e.g. no steaks) or social repercussions (e.g. loss of masculinity). Basically, asking oneself whether one thinks that any of the above reasons leads to a worse world generally speaking, without individual and personal participation. Even though it is often hard to take this birds eye view, it was necessary for me to change my behaviour. I learned about the effects of meat on climate change and multi-resistant germs in school and still ate meat every day. I knew the facts but was blissfully ignorant about them and justified eating meat with the high intake of calories for my triathlon training. When my sister became vegetarian and therefore dinner was served without meat I even saw this as a personal attack on me. I was angry with my sister because "she denied me the possibility to be as good as possible in triathlon". Only when I was forced to take the birds eye view on the issue because a friend asked me if I would design an optimal society with omnivors or vegetarians/vegans that I saw that my convictions do not align with my actions and I had to change the latter. I needed to remove myself and my emotional attachments from the equation and ask: "Is there a case against meat"?

### 2.2 What are the reasons currently holding me back?

The next step for behaviour change is to examine the underlying reasons of eating animal products. First and foremost, most people eat meat, yogurt, etc. because of its taste. In the last couple of years, however, plant based products have become so good of a replacement that they start to pass blind comparisons. Soy or wheat based burgers taste extremely good and almon or wheat milk is even more durable than cow milk while tasting slightly different but similarly good. The second reason I often face is a kind of habit or lack of inertia, i.e. people do not change diets because "it is too much of a hassle" or people literally do not know what to eat as a vegetarian because they assume we eat the same dish just without the meat (e.g. instead of fish with potatos we just eat potatos without anything else). If you hold this or similar beliefs I suggest just google 'insert your favorite meal here' + 'vegetarian' and you will find a surprising amount of vegetarian variations of you favorite meal. Lastly, we need to talk about social norms, a reason that I think is often underestimated when it comes to eating meat. An image that is particularly present for men and reinforced through the media and popculture is the image of the 'strong man'. A 'strong man' eats meat because it helps with muscle grows, it is healthy and it is what our ancestors ate. When someone who lives in a community where this image is particularly strong decides to eat less meat or even stop doing so they become 'weak men' in the eyes of the community very quickly. The social repercussions, the loss of status for such men is way higher than I had originally thought and it is really hard to pull off. However, the number of vegetarians is growing and the trend becomes more popular at fast pace. Therefore the number of people who are vegetarian and who come in contact with the members of that community is growing. Thus I think this norm will probably become weaker over time, even though it is a hard battle for these individuals to fight. Even though I already hinted at some of the possible steps of action, the emphasis in this paragraph lies on identifying the underlying reasons for ones current behaviour. 

### 2.3 What can I do to change my behaviour?



### 2.4 What are the trade-offs that I am willing to make?

A change of behaviour does not have to manifest in the adoption of veganism from one day to another. Cutting back meat consumption in half is already a 50% reduction in animal suffering and carbon emissions. The reduction in consumption also does not have to be from one day to the next as long as one has follows an overall strategy of reduction and is willing to do small steps and get used to the new situation. Overall, I want to point out tht 

***One last note:***

If you have any feedback regarding anything (i.e. layout, code or opinions) I would be happy if you told me. But please do it in a constructive manner.
