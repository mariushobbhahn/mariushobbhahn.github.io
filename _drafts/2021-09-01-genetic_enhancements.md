## **What is this post about?**

When you go into the supermarket in Germany, a lot of food packaging contains phrases such as "not genetically modified" or "something something natural". 

TODO: figures

In general, most people in Germany strongly oppose <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism'>genetically modified organisms (GMO)</a>. Ironically, the cows that produce the milk or cheese might not be genetically modified in the sense that their genes weren't modified in the lab but their high milk output is by no means "natural" but comes from hundreds of years of selective breeding. 

I think this stance against GMOs is completely wrong and want to argue why we should be in favour of modifying plants, animals and even humans. Furthermore, this stance is actually harmful since there are still people who die from hunger or suffer from illness that could easily be solved by GMOs like <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rice'>golden rice</a>. Obviously, I don't support every form of manipulation, but a lot of them. 

### Summary

The case for genetically modifying an organism is pretty simple. We want to reduce bad properties and increase good properties. Obviously, as with many other tools, there is misuse, unknown side effects, etc. However, the more I think and read about the topic, the more I'm convinced that the upsides massively outweigh the downsides. Furthermore, most counterarguments seem rather unrealistic upon closer look and I don't find them particularly plausible.

Plants no brainer 99:1, humans 90:10, animals 80:20 because the animals can't communicate

## Framing

Before we dive into the details, let's make a couple of things clear.

#### Most food isn't "natural"

Most of the food generating process has changed a lot over the last couple of hundred years. The chicken, cows and goat that produce eggs, dairy and meat have been selectively bread to increase their output. A standard milk-cow today produces around <a href='https://www.compassioninfoodbusiness.com/awards/good-dairy-award/standard-intenstive-milk-production/'>28L/day</a>  whereas an unoptimized cow would produce about 4L/day. In 1900 hens laid between <a href='https://www.thehappychickencoop.com/a-history-of-chickens/'>80-150 eggs per year</a> whereas today 300-350 is normal. The same story can be told for meat production, where chickens, cows, pigs and co are optimized to grow and be slaughtered as fast as possible. 

This trend is not unique to animals. Plants have been selectively bread as well. They give more yield, are more robust to different weather events and pesticides, taste better, look better and much more. To give you a better understanding of the difference consider these five common foods (<a href='https://www.businessinsider.com/common-foods-before-and-after-domestication-2016-2'>source</a>).

So in nearly all cases, the alternative to genetically modified is not "natural" but rather selectively bread. For this post, I will endorse both methods, because they basically achieve the same goal through a slightly different path. In both cases, an organism is changed with a specific goal in mind. Breeding takes longer and is less targeted but genetic modifications require more understanding of the organism. In the end though, you get a more resistant crop or a bigger chicken. 

#### I don't support everything related to genetic modification

Obviously there are goals and practices related to genetic modification that are bad or suboptimal. If somebody wanted to create animals that suffer more, it would be pretty horrifying. 

The agro-chemical industry, e.g. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto'>Monsanto</a>, have a pretty bad reputation for exploiting farmers. They provide a range of products that only work in combination with each other, so if you buy their seeds, you also need to buy their fertilizer. Furthermore, they only provide seeds that do not reproduce, such that farmers have to buy them again every year.  While I don't support all of these practices, I think they are much more reasonable than their public perception. Firstly, if you genetically change a food, you remove all the stuff that doesn't increase yield. So all the stuff that is used for reproduction is removed such that our aubergines are even bigger. Secondly, if they can't reproduce, they can also not cross-breed with wild plants to create the wildly feared "mega-mutations". Thirdly, making better fertilizer and other products is probably pretty hard, so it seems plausible to me that a company would start by creating products that work with their seeds. 
In the end, they are still a profit driven company and they won't gift the farmers anything but I would say they are probably not the evil corp that is often depicted in the media (at least in Germany).

#### "playing god"

Whenever you talk about genetic enhancements, there is someone saying we shouldn't do it because "we would be playing god". Clearly, we are interfering with nature all the time. We build damns to stop floods, we use medicine to combat sickness, we use cars, planes and trains to move faster, we use the internet to communicate globally in real time. So clearly we are changing the environment in major ways.
Ok, but these are not changing the DNA of an organism. But even that we do all the time. We selectively breed farm animals and plants to give higher yields and be more resistant. The cute little pets we have are the result of hundreds of generations of targeted breedings efforts. So we also change the DNA of some organisms.
Ok, but we aren't changing the DNA of humans. Well, actually we do. For example, gene therapy is used to treat the genes of somatic cells to eradicate diseases. So if you are happy that your friends cancer can be treated with gene therapy, why wouldn't you be happy, if we could remove some diseases from the gene pool altogether?

To me, the "playing god" argument is mostly a manifestation of the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias'>status quo bias</a> or the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalistic_fallacy'>naturalistic fallacy</a>. Clearly, there are some counterarguments to gene editing and I will discuss them further down the post, but the "playing god" argument is a really bad one. If you had the chance to feed millions of people or to eradicate diseases and you choose not to do it, you're still making an active decision---you're still playing god, just the old testament version.

## Plants

I think genetically manipulating plants or selectively breeding them is a complete no brainer. But even this, some people oppose. So let's look at the arguments.

#### The pros

There are a ton of things we can do to improve plans by selective breedings or genetic enhancements. We can increase their yield by a lot. We can make them more resistant to diseases. This not only increases yield but also means less insectisides are needed. We can add certain components such as vitamin A in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rice'>golden rice</a>. We can make wheat smaller such that less nutriants are wasted in the stem and more go to the yield and that they are less likely to fall over from the wind. We can make them more resistant to changing climate conditions which comes in handy with climate change. The list goes on ... for any problem that you can think of, somebody probably tried to solve it already. Of course that doesn't always work but the improvements we already have are astonishing. 

The consequence of this is more food, improved food security, lower malnourishment and much more. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug#Dwarfing'>Norman Borlaug</a> is "was often called 'the father of the Green Revolution', and is credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation." 

About one billion (!) people suffer from Vitamin A deficiency and about 2.7 million children under the age of 5 could be saved annually just by providing sufficient amounts of vitamin A. Then, in the 1990s, somebody created <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rice'>golden rice</a> which is engineered to biosynthesize beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A. They ran trials and confirmed that golden rice was effective in treating the vitamin A deficiency, did not lead to undesired side effects in humans and did not mutate or cross-bread. However, Greenpeace and other environmental organisations lobbied governments to ban golden rice because it would "open the door for other GMOs". In 2021, over 30 years after its creation, the Philippines were the first country to fully legalize the production and distribution of golden rice as the first developing country. 

Honestly, this might be one of the most overlooked catastrophies in human history where we sacrifices millions of children for some nonsense concern that was neither backed by data nor by experts. 

#### The cons

There are a host of possible negative consequences of GMOs (see e.g. <a href='https://www.fao.org/english/newsroom/focus/2003/gmo8.htm'>this UN report from 2003</a>). Most of them are concerned with interactions of genetically manipulated foods and conventional plants. They include:  a) Gene escape, e.g. that herbicide-resistance genes could escape to other plants, b) potential mutations from the genes, c) Reductions of biodiversity by expansive species, and d) impact on birds, insects and the general eco-system. 

#### The trade-offs

Regarding the cons, there is a list of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_food_controversies'>Genetically modified food controversies</a> on Wikipedia which states that "There is a scientific consensus that currently available food derived from GM crops poses no greater risk to human health than conventional food ...". So all of the cons neither have a strong precedent, nor a strong theory of change, nor the backing of the scientific community.

Furthermore, all of these concerns are also true for most other stuff we do in agriculture. If we do selective breeding, we change the gene pool of a plant of animals in uncertain ways. If we apply fertilizer or insecticides, we could negatively impact the biosphere. I would go even further and say that the currently legal alternatives are even worse because they are the result of a random change whereas genetic modification is usually targeted and thus only changes one thing. Additionally, most GMOs cannot reproduce. Therefore, the likelihood of cross breeding is even less likely than with organisms resulting from selective breeding. 
So if people think that genetic enhancements are categorically different or worse than current methods, I feel like the burden is on them to provide a strong reason. I currently don't see it, but I'm willing to change my mind if somebody presents me with one. 

Ignoring the weakness of the cons for a second, the pros are also just insanely strong. Being able to feed Billions of people and preventing tens of millions of child deaths are probably among the best possible interventions out there. I can't think of any medication that comes even close to being responsible for that many lives saved. So I feel like the default really should be "LETS SAVE THE CHILDREN" and the burden is on the critics to provide evidence for the negative effects of GMOs. 

For this article, I really wanted to understand why there is so much hesitancy around GMOs and uncover the hidden reasons I haven't considered before, but the deeper I dug, the more one sided the picture became for me: GMOs can have an insanely large upside and usually have no or a small downside.

## Animals

Just to be clear, I would prefer a world in which we would mostly be vegan or vegetarian. Then, a lot of genetic changes / selective breeding wouldn't be necessary to begin with. Unfortunately, this is not (yet) the world we live in. Meat and dairy consumption is rising globally and thus I think it is necessary to talk about animals. 

TODO: OWID link or figure

#### The pros

Firstly, genetic modifications of animals have lead to **drastic increases in productivity**. Cows give much more milk, hens lay more eggs and chickens for consumption grow much faster. Also, most animals are more disease resistant now, so that less resources are wasted to animals that die of sickness. The consequence of this is not only more product, but also less resources per product, e.g. less animal feed, less space and less CO2/methane per output. So if we assume that people eat a lot of meat, we at least reduce the amount of waste produced as a byproduct.

Secondly, we can **modify the animals in other beneficial ways**. For example, we could change cows such that they produce less methane and thereby reduce their climate footprint. We can increase disease resistances further such that the animals live happier lives. Lastly, we might be able to modify them to experience less suffering some day. I would obviously prefer abolishing factory farms and people becoming vegans / vegetarians but in a world where factory farms exist I would at least not want the animals to suffer. 

#### The cons

Most **genetic modifications that increase output likely also increase animal suffering as byproduct**. If a cow produces more milk, there is more pressure on its odder (?) which can cause pain. The chicken that produces more and larger eggs likely also experiences more suffering. And, or course, broiler chickens likely lead absolutely terrible lives. Their body weight increases so fast, that their bones break from the pressure which renders them unable to move and in pain. There are additional sources of suffering coming from the lack of space, sickness and many more. These are a result of factory farms and not genetic modifications but they still imply suffering.

The **higher productivity leads to lower prices which increases consumption**. The fact that you can grow a chicken to full size in a couple of months means that it costs less. And if 1kg of chicken costs like 2€ more people will buy it. Therefore, there are more chicken in factory farms to satisfy the increased demand at the lower price. If there were no genetic modifications of meat and dairy, they would be so expensive that most people would not be able to afford them and thus there would be less animal suffering. This would also reduce the carbon footprint, water use and land use of meat consumption.

#### The trade-offs

I find the weighing for animals much harder than for plants but would still conclude in favor of genetic engineering. 

Whether **genetic modifications increased demand or increased demand lead to genetic modifications** is a classic chicken and egg problem. My intuition is that more people wanted to eat more meat and thus farmers came up with more efficient ways to produce it. Thus, the alternative would be that there are more less efficient animals to meet the demand. The consequence would be even more suffering, land-use and emissions. But I'm a bit uncertain about this trade-off. 

Secondly, there is the question of **how strong the negative output of genetic modification is compared to the negative output of a larger number of animals**. For example, are 7 cows producing 4 liters of milk per day worse than one cow producing 28 liters or is one genetically modified fast growing chicken suffering more than 5 unmodified chicken? My intuition is that for the cow less numbers are better, just because every additional cow produces more GHG emissions, needs more food, water, etc. For the chicken I'm less certain because I would imagine that they suffer intensely. But even then, as long as people still want to eat cheap meat, the alternative is factory farming with unmodified chicken not free range paradise. So the net suffering of more chicken is probably worse just because factory farming is horrible. 

My **biggest worry** is that we completely underestimate the harms that genetic modification does to the animal. For example, I would estimate that the pain from a really full udder is mild but since we can't ask the cow it's hard to reduce uncertainty. My hope is that we would actively modify animals to feel less pain to reduce their suffering but since this is just a cost factor for the farmers and most consumers care about animal welfare, I don't see this happening on its own. So the horror scenario would be that genetic modification causes intense suffering and nobody cares about it. But given the weighings above, I'm in favor of genetically modifying animals and promoting them further to reduce their suffering. 

## Humans 

What does gene editing in humans look like? Not frankenstein or super smart babies but rather small changes mostly. 

Indulge in the fantasy, let's go transhumanism

#### The pros

Reduce the bad things

improve the good things

#### The cons

inequality

changing people against their will

#### The trade-offs

inequality vs. everyone gets better 

they didn't ask to be born
