In this post I wanna lay out a couple of different books, podcasts and other forms of media I consume and give a short pitch of their content. This list will be continuously updated over time when I have new recommendations. If you think there is something missing on feel free to contact me via your prefered means of communication. As a caviat I need to point out that the media I consume are obviously reflective of the values I hold and the bubble I chose to be in. I do not claim to have a representative view of anything so don't come at me with 'You are such a Leftist, Rationalist, Bayesian, Effective Altruist, etc.', because I am. 

TODO: provide links to all the blogs and yt.

## **Media:**

### a) print media:

	1. **The Economist** A socially liberal and market open newspaper that covers political and economic issues on a global scale. The articles are well written and very have high information density. Very good to keep updated on all major things happening aroudn the world.

	2. **Die ZEIT** A german newspaper covering all major issues around the world. I would mostly recommend them for very high quality detailed analysis of political and social issues. For econ I think the Economist is better. Written in German, if you don't speak it just read the Economist. 

### b) online media: 

	1. **Youtube:** There are like a Million high quality YouTube channels out there but I just want to recommend some that I found particularly interesting or had a big influence on my thinking:

	  * TODO

	2. **Blogs:** I never really stuck to consistently reading a blog or website of a person or institution consistently. The only ones that made me come back from time to time are the following ones: For tech news and revelations in the field of ML I check out the OpenAI and DeepMind blog. For AI security I read the alignment forum. For US politics with a framing on strategy I consult fivethirtyeight and for interesting takes on social, economic and science views I read slate star codex. 


## **Podcasts:**

	1. **Freaconomics Radio:** 45-60 Minute episodes about social and econ topics. IMO very well researched and tries to give a fair and accurate overview over the scientific status quo over a topic. 
	2. **Rationally Speaking:** 45-60 Minute episodes about topics concerning rationality and effective altruism. Julias ability to ask exactly the question that I have in mind in every eposide is astonishing every single time. Sometimes a bit hit and miss.
	3. **The Inquiry:** 25 Minute episodes about a controversial topic from the news. Four experts are asked for their opinion for both sides of a topic. IMO mostly a good overview over the different perspectives of a topic. I am often able to take away a new argument or framing w.r.t. any topic, specifically if the theme is a bit niche. 
	4. **FiveThirtyEight:** Most useful for a more strategic overview over any form of political actions in the US. If you are a stats or modeling person I can very much recommend the model talk episodes.
	5. **ZEIT Verbrechen:** German podcast series dealing with historical moments in Germans crime and law history. Pretty interesting content, but unfortunately not very information dense. I mostly listen to it at double speed or while trying to relax. 
	6. **DeepMind Podcast:** Great overview over the current state of the DeepMind research areas. For people with ML background maybe a bit superficial but still useful, great for everyone else. 


## **Books:**
	1. **Thinkin Fast and Slow:** Definitely one of my favorites. Great introduction to human biases and decision making. Had a great influence on my view of rationality and decision making.
	2. **Bear Neuroscience:** More of a niche recommendation. It was the lecture book for my neuroscience classes but I was surprised by how easy it is to read and how well made the graphics and explanations are. Only for people interested in neuroscience.
	3. **Nudge:** Good introduction into the science of nudging, i.e. a way to make people behave in a way that is good for them and society and increases the chance of them achieving their own long term goals. 
	4. **Elephant in the brain:** TODO
	5. **The selfish gene:** This book changed the way I think about motivations and behaviour in a strong way. It poses the hypotheses that humans mostly act as a vessel of our genes and consciousness, volition and other higher order concepts are merely a proxy to achieve the procreation of our genes in a more effective way. I was surprised by how much explanatory power this hypotheses has and definitely think it has a very high degree of validity even if other factors probably also play a role. 
	6. **Inadequate equilibria:** If you always wonder why 'everyone but me and my peers is acting so dumb' read this book. It explores some reasons as to why the outcome of many people working together can be negative even when everyone has good intentions and how to break these 'inadequate equilibria'. 
	7. **Poor economics:** Gave me some really good insights about the decision making processes and rationality of poor people. The authors won the nobel price for economics in 2019 and the quality of the book definitely reflects that.
	8. **Harry Potter and the methods or rationality:** Harry Potter fanfiction written by Eliezer Yudkowsky. Deals with many questions of science and rationality in the world of Harry Potter. Even though it is a 1500 page pdf I read it in under a week. Can only recommend it.
	9. **A Song of Ice and Fire:** The only fantasy book I am still able to read without getting bored. In most of the fantasy literature you follow one hero on their journey to fight a great evil. After 300 pages of training montage, a romance and old wise people giving advice they finally face and defeat the enemy by some random trick that was entirely unforeseeable by the audience. In ASOIF that is not the case. Bad decisions get you killed and the characters are more than one-dimensional heros.

***One last note:***

If you have any feedback regarding anything (i.e. layout, code or opinions) I would be happy if you told me. But please do it in a constructive manner.
